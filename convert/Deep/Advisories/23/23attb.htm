<h2><a NAME="Materials">Materials Recovery Facilities (MRF)</a> </h2>

<p>A MRF is a facility which sorts and processes materials that are collected elsewhere
and brought to the MRF for the purpose of recovery of recyclable materials. The transfer
of wastes is an integral part of the operation. The transfer facilities at a MRF are
relatively smaller than transfer stations because recyclables have been removed from the
waste stream. </p>

<p>In general, the primary purpose of sorting operations is to separate recyclable from
non-recyclable materials. Sorting may consist of a can separator, a conveyor with
hand-sorting stations, or a mixed waste processing system with a magnet operation for
segregation of ferrous metals, mechanical screens, separators and classifiers. Large
objects may be separated from small objects, and high density from low density items with
an air clarifying system, centrifugal system, or other appropriate system. Volume may be
reduced by shredding and compaction. </p>

<p>At present, most MRFs are not separate, independent facilities, but are often
incorporated into new or existing transfer stations. Those MRFs that are part of larger
facilities are rarely accessible to the public. However, since operations are potentially
dangerous, it is important that the public be excluded from access to the
sorting/processing areas. The safety of the employees who perform the actual separation of
recoverables from the waste stream will require close observation by the inspector. The
inspector should determine whether appropriate safety equipment, including that required
by the LEA, is being used. </p>

<p>There are two basic types of MRFs: Clean MRFS and dirty MRFs. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Clean&quot; MRFs</strong> are facilities that receive materials which have been
segregated from the general waste stream, generally through a curbside collection program.
In a fully source separated system each material type arrives at the facility separate
from all others, or where only one material is recovered, as in a cardboard only
collection from retail businesses. These facilities usually do not require a SWFP as they
accept only segregated recyclables and have minor amounts of residual waste for disposal. </p>

<p>A <strong>&quot;dirty&quot; MRF</strong> receives a mixed waste stream of recoverable resources
which have not been separated from the municipal solid waste stream. These materials may
be known as commingled recyclables. In a fully commingled system, mixed waste materials
arrive completely mixed together. In this case, the wastes are brought into a processing
facility and as many recyclables are removed as can be marketed. </p>

<p>After gaining access to a MRF, the inspector should first go to the sorting area (not
found at transfer stations) to determine if waste has been removed according to schedule
and that the area has been cleaned properly from the previous day's operations. This area
must be closely evaluated by the inspector for potential health and safety problems,
including those related to conveyor belts, eye protection, and dust. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2><strong><a NAME="Transformation">Transformation/Waste-To-Energy Facilities (WTEF)</a></strong> 
</h2>

<p>Transformation means incineration, pyrolysis, distillation, gasification, or biological
conversion other than composting. Transformation processes are used to reduce the volume
and weight of waste requiring disposal and recover conversion products and energy. The
only type of transformation facilities currently permitted by the Board are WTEFs. As
stated above, those facilities engaged in transformation processes shall be considered
transfer/processing stations. Typically, the collection vehicles are weighed at the
scalehouse and the wastes unloaded into the storage pit. A crane mixes the waste in the
pit, removes bulky items, and then picks up the waste and deposits it into a feed chute
which leads to the furnace. The residual ash is processed for the removal of scrap iron. </p>

<p>A major part of the inspection will be concerned with documenting that these facilities
are operating according to the conditions of their SWFP including any related air emission
standards. </p>

<p>When inspecting WTEF, the inspector will be faced with several issues not found at a
standard transfer station. One issue is pit management. Section 17513 - Solid Waste
Removal, requires waste to be removed from the pit every 48 hours or in accordance with an
approved operations schedule. An LEA approved operations schedule could allow a portion of
waste to remain for longer than 48 hours in a properly managed pit. This is allowed in
order to maintain a continuous fuel supply to the combustion chamber during times when the
facility is not receiving waste. </p>

<p>Another issue is the disposal of ash and metal. While WTEF that burn municipal solid
waste (MSW) realize at least an 80-90 percent volume reduction, 10-20 percent remains in
the form of ash or metal. This ash may be hazardous, abrasive, or caustic, and could
create dust problems. The inspector must determine whether the ash is being properly
handled and stored on-site, tested to determine if it is a hazardous, designated or solid
waste, and ultimately disposed at a facility permitted to receive it. Proper handling of
ash should address adequate personnel protective equipment, including respirators, gloves,
coveralls, and eye protection. </p>

<p>Currently, there are three permitted waste-to-energy facilities operating in California
which burn municipal solid wastes. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2><a NAME="Statutes"><strong>Statutes/Regulations Guidance</strong></a> </h2>

<p>Following are the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and Title 14 for small and
large transfer stations, materials recovery facilities, and waste-to-energy/transformation
facilities. The laws/regulations are bolded and italicized, with guidance listed
immediately below. </p>

<h2><strong>Permits</strong> </h2>

	<h3>44002 Operator Authorized by Solid Waste Facility Permit </h3>

<p><i><strong>The operation of a solid waste facility by any person, except as authorized
pursuant to a solid waste facilities permit issued by the enforcement agency, is
prohibited.</strong></i> </p>

<p>If the current operator of a facility is found to be different from the operator listed
on the permit, it is a violation of this section. Also, if the facility has never been
permitted and it has been determined by the Board and LEA that this site now needs a
permit, it is a violation of this section. </p>

	<h3>44004 Significant Change </h3>

<p><i><strong>(a) No operator of a solid waste facility shall make a significant change in the
design or operation of any solid waste facility except in conformance with the terms and
conditions in an approved solid waste facilities permit or revised solid waste facilities
permit issued to the operator. </strong></i></p>

<p><i><strong>(b) If the operator wishes to modify the design or operation of a solid waste
facility, the operator shall file an application for revision of the existing solid waste
facilities permit with the enforcement agency. The application shall be filed at least 120
days in advance of the date when the proposed modification is to take place. </strong></i></p>

<p><i><strong>(c) Under circumstances which present an immediate danger to public health and
safety or the environment, as determined by the enforcement agency, the 120-day filing
period may be waived. </strong></i></p>

<p>Title 14, � 18211(c) states, &quot;A change shall be deemed significant for purposes
of this section if and only if it does not conform to terms and conditions of the
permit.&quot; If the LEA has made a determination that the site has undergone a
significant change in facility conditions from those allowed by the SWFP and RFI, and
documented the determination in a permit review report or SWIS inspection report, a
violation should be noted for PRC � 44004 - Significant Change <u>and</u> PRC � 44014(b)
- Permit Terms and Conditions. A significant change may prompt further California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis, as well as a revision of the SWFP. Note that
Board inspectors may make a determination of significant change only after consultation
with the LEA, the Board's permit and environmental review staff and his/her supervisor. </p>

<p>Significant changes which are most often found in violation include: tonnage increases,
expansion of operations into property not within the current permitted boundary, new
operations (composting, energy recovery, etc.) and the acceptance of unpermitted wastes
such as ash, sewage sludge, and designated non-hazardous wastes which require special
handling. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

	<h3>44014(b) Permit Terms and Conditions<i> </i></h3>

<p><i><strong>The permit shall contain all terms and conditions which the enforcement agency
determines to be appropriate for the operation of the solid waste facility. The operator
shall comply with all terms and conditions of the permit.</strong> </i></p>

<p>If the inspector finds that the operator is not complying with all terms and conditions
of the current valid SWFP (e.g., due to a significant change in operations), it is a
violation of this section. Items which may not constitute a significant change, such as a
violation of specific monitoring requirements of the SWFP or the inclusion of recycling
operations or the receipt of special waste not described in the SWFP or RFI, may
constitute a violation in accordance with this section. </p>

<p>The inspector should note an area of concern if the SWFP does not include a daily peak
volume limit and the permitted average volume has been exceeded on any given day. This
should only apply to old permits as all new SWFPs contain daily peak volume limits. </p>

	<h3>18213(b) Review of Permits </h3>

<p><i><strong>No less than 120 days before the permit is due for review, the operator shall
submit an application for review of its permit. The application shall be made in the
manner specified in section 18201. Sections 18202 through 18208 shall apply to the
application for review.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Section 18213(a) requires that every permit be reviewed, and if necessary, revised at
least once every five years. Subsection (b) sets the time frame for the operator to submit
an application for the permit review. This section is in violation if the operator has not
submitted an application for permit review at least 120 days prior to the required review <i>and</i>
the review was not completed by the due date. </p>

<h2><a NAME="Standards"><strong>Standards Applicability (Small Volume vs. Large Volume Transfer
Station)</strong></a> </h2>

	<h3>17401 Applicability of Standards </h3>

<p><i><strong>Stations which receive less than 100 cubic yards of wastes per operating day
shall be governed by only Sections 17400 through 17426. All stations receiving more than
100 cubic yards of waste per operating day shall be governed by only Sections 17400
through 17413 and Sections 17440 through 17564. The standards contained in this Article
shall be in force for all stations which are in operation on or after July 1, 1976, or
prior to that date if provided in the county solid waste management plan developed and
approved pursuant to Section 66780 of the Government Code. (Note: Sections 17400 and 17440
do not exist).</strong></i> </p>

<p>The volume of wastes and recyclables which are commingled with wastes which enter the
facility determines whether the facility is regulated as a small volume or large volume
transfer station. Source separated recyclables do not count toward the volume; however,
recyclable materials which enter the facility commingled with wastes (i.e.,
non-recyclables) count toward the total volume of waste received. </p>

<h2><a NAME="SmallTS"><strong>Small Volume Transfer Stations</strong></a> </h2>

<p>Stations which receive less than 100 cubic yards of wastes per operating day are
classified as small volume transfer stations. </p>

	<h3>17421 Exclusions </h3>

<p><i><strong>These standards shall not be construed to apply to those locations where less
than 15 cubic yards of combined container volume is provided to serve as community or
multi-residence receptacles for residential refuse, nor do they apply to storage
receptacles for waste from multi-residential buildings or for commercial solid wastes; a
container used to store construction or demolition wastes at the place of generation; or
containers used to store salvaged materials.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2><strong>Design</strong> </h2>

	<h3>17422 Design </h3>

<p><i><strong>The engineering design of proposed new small volume transfer stations shall be in
accordance with the principles and disciplines in the State of California generally
accepted for design of this type of facility. The design of each new small volume transfer
station shall be submitted to the Enforcement Agency for review.</strong></i> </p>

<p>It is Board policy to determine a site to be in compliance with this section if the
facility was given a grandfathered permit (i.e., commenced operations prior to July 1,
1976). If unsure of the adequacy of a design, the inspector may contact the Board's
Closure and Remediation Branch environmental engineering staff for technical assistance. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2><strong>Records</strong> </h2>

	<h3>17423 Plan of Operation </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each operator of a small volume transfer station shall prepare and submit to the
Enforcement Agency a plan of operation for the station summarizing procedures for handling
complaints, maintenance, health and safety, site controls, and frequency of removal of
wastes from the station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>If a plan of operation has not been submitted or if it does not have the above
mentioned elements, this standard has been violated. </p>

	<h3>17424 Records </h3>

<p><i><strong>An annual report shall be made to the Enforcement Agency reporting the estimated
weights or volumes handled during the previous year and listing special occurrences such
as fires, injury, property damage, accidents, explosions, incidents regarding hazardous
wastes, flooding, and other unusual occurrences.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

	<h3>17441 Report of Station Information </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each operator of a transfer/processing station, as defined in Public Resources
Code section 40200, must file with the enforcement agency a Report of Station Information
or, if the station is a Small Volume Transfer Station, a Plan of Operation. (See section
18221 of this title for content requirements of the Report/Plan.) The information
contained in the Report or Plan shall be used by the enforcement agency to determine
whether a permit should be issued. The operator must file amendments to the Report or Plan
whenever necessary to keep the information contained in it current.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should read and become familiar with the most recent and/or governing RFI
(the governing RFI is the one specifically referenced in the most current SWFP with
concurrence by the Board) before going to a site. The inspector should bring the working
file with a copy of the RFI along on the inspection. The most recent RFI and amendment(s)
must reflect current site operations as evaluated during the inspection. If changes in
operation have been made, amendments which keep RFI information current must be filed with
the LEA and forwarded to the Board. Documentation of receipt by the EA is needed to prove
filing. </p>

<p>When applying Section 17441, the inspector should record all discrepancies between the
most recent RFI (and any amendments) and actual design and operations in the field notes.
If the most recent RFI is not the governing RFI, this should be stated in the inspection
report. It should also be explained to the permittee that the most recent RFI and any
necessary amendments shall be incorporated into the SWFP. Section 17441 requires that
amendments to the RFI be filed, but it does not require that they be concurred with by the
Board. However, the operator may be required to revise or modify the SWFP prior to
implementing the changes proposed in the RFI. The RFI need not duplicate information
contained in the Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD) or Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs). </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2><strong>Operations</strong> </h2>

	<h3>17425 Small Volume Transfer Station Operation </h3>

<p><i><strong>Small volume transfer stations shall be operated in conformance with good
operating practices which result in minimal public health and safety hazards, minimal
vector propagation, containment of waste materials, pickup of litter, control of drainage
and nuisances, and shall comply with those requirements of the Enforcement Agency adopted
to achieve these results.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Under this standard, it is possible for the inspector to enforce any actions consistent
with maintaining good operating practice. For example, an attended site in a remote area
should be required to have a telephone or radio, sanitary facilities and a water supply,
if no facilities are located nearby. The absence or adequacy of any of these should be
evaluated using this standard. </p>

<h3>Cleaning/Waste Removal </h3>

	<h3>17426 Cleaning and Waste Removal Frequency </h3>

<p><i><strong>The small volume transfer station shall be thoroughly cleaned weekly or as
required in the solid waste facilities permit. Any solid wastes deposited at the site
shall be removed weekly or as required in the solid waste facilities permit.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should try to inspect the site on the specified cleaning or waste removal
day to verify compliance with this section.</p>
