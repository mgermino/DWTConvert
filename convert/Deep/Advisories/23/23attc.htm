    <h2><a NAME="LargeTS">Large Volume Transfer Stations, Materials Recovery Facilities, and
Waste-To-Energy Facilities</a> </h2>

<p>Stations which receive 100 cubic yards or more of wastes per operating day are
classified as large volume transfer stations. Currently, no specific regulations exist for
evaluation of MRFs and WTEFs. At this time, these facilities are regulated under 14 CCR,
Chapter 3, Article 6, Transfer/Processing Stations. </p>

	<h3>18221 Report of Station Information (RSI) </h3>

<p><i><strong>In order to obtain a solid waste facilities permit, each operator of a
transfer/processing station, as defined in Public Resources Code section 40200, must file
with the Enforcement Agency a Report of Station Information or, if the station a Small
Volume Transfer Station, a Plan of Operation as required in section 17441 of this Title.
In order to maintain the permit, the operator must file amendments as required in section
17441 of this Title. Such amendments or lack thereof may become the basis for changes in
the permit or revocation of the permit. A Report of Station Information shall contain the
following:</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(a) Plans and specifications for the station, to include a site location map, a
site plan, and identification of adjacent land uses and distances to nearby residences.</strong></i>
</p>

<p><i><strong>(b) An engineering report describing processes to be used, including proposed
pollution control devices and estimated quantities and types of solid wastes to be
processed. Information of proprietary nature need not be disclosed.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(c) A descriptive statement of the operations conducted at the station.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(d) A schematic drawing of the buildings and other structures showing layout and
general dimensions for unloading, storage, compaction, processing, parking and loading
areas.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(e) A descriptive statement including the means to control litter, odors,
rodents, and insects; emergency provisions for equipment breakdown or power failure; and
the maximum length of time solid waste will be stored in the station.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(f) The description of transfer equipment including type, capacity and number of
units.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(g) An estimate of the design capacity and current daily capacity of the station
in tons.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(h) A description of provisions to handle unusual peak loadings.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(i) Anticipated amount and planned method for final disposal of nonrecoverable or
nonmarketable residues or ashes.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(j) Anticipated volume of quench or process water required and planned method of
treatment and disposal of any wastewater.</strong></i> </p>

<p><i><strong>(k) Resume of the management organization which will operate the station.</strong></i>
</p>

<p><i><strong>(l) A compilation of conditions, criteria, and requirements reestablished by the
various approval agencies having jurisdiction over the station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Generally, this standard is evaluated during the permitting process. In the event that
a SWFP is issued and it is later determined that the requirements of this standard were
not adequately addressed in the RFI, a violation of this standard may be noted. </p>

<p>Do not cite section 18221 for discrepancies between the RFI and site operations. These
discrepancies are addressed by section 17441 and/or PRC sections 44002, 44004, and
44014(b). </p>

<h2>Records </h2>

	<h3>17441 Report of Station Information </h3>

<p>See small volume transfer stations section 17441 for regulatory language and guidance
on this standard. </p>

<p>Prior to the inspection of a facility, the inspector should read and become familiar
with the Report of Station Information (RSI). The inspector should bring the working file
and a copy of the RSI along on the inspection. The RSI must reflect current facility
operations as evaluated during the inspection and, if changes have been made, an amendment
must have been filed with the EA in order to keep RSI information current. The inspector
should record all discrepancies between the conditioning RSI (referenced in the SWFP) and
actual operations. If the most recent RSI is not the conditioning RSI, this should be
stated in the inspection report; the most recent RSI and amendments must be incorporated
into the SWFP through the next permit modification or revision. </p>

<p>Deficiencies of the most current RSI with regard to content requirements or actual
operations become the basis for a violation of section 17441. This section requires that
amendments to the RSI be filed, but does not require that they be concurred with by the
Board until the next modification or revision of the SWFP. Discrepancies between actual
operations and the current permit including its conditioning RSI are addressed by PRC
sections 44002, 44004, and 44014(b). </p>

	<h3>17461 Weight Volume Records </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each station operator shall maintain records of weights or volumes handled in a
manner and form approved by the Enforcement Agency. Such records shall be sufficiently
accurate for overall planning and control purposes.</strong></i> </p>

<p>If a site has scales, the accuracy of records is easy to calculate since records are
maintained by weight (i.e., tare vs. total weight). Tare is defined as the weight of a
vehicle deducted from the total weight to determine the weight of the load. At sites
without scales, where cubic yardage is converted to tonnage, it is important that the
operator provide reasonable documentation verifying accuracy of weight or volume records.
If cubic yardage is converted to tonnage, the site operator must be able to supply a
conversion factor or conversion procedure that can be justified. If the facility waste
input figures are in cubic yards and no conversion factor exists for determining tonnages,
the following conversion factors may be used for the purposes of the inspection: 

<ul>
  <li>220 lbs/yd3 for private vehicle waste loads </li>
  <li>500 lbs/yd3 for residential compacted waste </li>
  <li>1600 lbs/yd3 for sewage sludge </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The above figures for municipal waste are from <i>Managing Sanitary Landfill
operations, May 1989, Government Refuse Collection and Disposal Association</i>. The
figure for sewage sludge is from <i>Conversion Factors for Individual Material Types </i>by
the Tellus Institute <strong>(Appendix C)</strong>. </p>

<p>The inspector must also determine whether records are kept in the form and manner
required by the LEA. </p>

	<h3>17462 Special Occurrences </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each operator of a station handling an average of 100 or more cubic yards of
waste per operating day shall maintain a log of the following information; fires, injury
and property damage accidents, explosions, incidents regarding hazardous wastes, flooding
and other unusual occurrences.</strong></i> </p>

<p>This log should be maintained as a single entity at one location, for example, as a
bound logbook, a file stored in a cabinet, or electronically as a clearly identified
computer file. The log should serve as a record of these situations, their resolution, and
an indicator of recurrent hazards or trends which can affect operations. Daily entries are
encouraged in order to discover patterns early and to develop a regular routine of entry.
If there are no special occurrences on a given day, it is recommended that &quot;No
special occurrences&quot; or a similar entry be made. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

	<h3>17463 Inspection of Records </h3>

<p><i><strong>The records shall be open to inspection by authorized representatives of the
enforcement agency, the local health entity and other duly authorized regulatory and
enforcement agencies during normal business hours. Information of a proprietary nature, if
identified as confidential pursuant to Governments Code Section 6250 et seq., shall be
treated as confidential.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Records should not be in an unreasonable location such as another state. If records are
kept at another location other than the facility, the inspector should travel to that
location and view the records on the day of the inspection or, if not possible, request
that the operator send copies of the records to the inspector within two weeks of the
inspection. </p>

<h2>Information </h2>

	<h3>17442 Station Modifications </h3>

<p><i><strong>The Enforcement Agency shall be notified of significant changes in the design or
operation of the station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2>Design </h2>

<p>The following three standards (Sections 17451, 17452, and 17453) address station design
and apply to design problems which impact users, personnel and/or operating machinery.
Board staff consider a site to be in compliance with each of the Design Standards (17451,
17452, 17453) if the site was given a grandfathered permit (i.e., the site was operating
before July 1, 1976). Sites which commenced operations on or after July 1, 1976, should be
evaluated to determine if inadequate site design has resulted in violations of other SMS
as identified in these regulations. Closure and Remediation Branch staff can provide
technical assistance in the evaluation of complex designs. CEQA documents may contain
relevant information concerning site design. </p>

	<h3>17451 Design Responsibility </h3>

<p><i><strong>The design of a new station shall utilize expert advice, as appropriate, from
persons competent in engineering, architecture, landscape design, traffic engineering, air
quality control, and design of structures.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

	<h3>17452 General Design Parameters </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each station design shall be based on appropriate data regarding the service
area, anticipated nature and quantity of wastes to be received, climatological factors,
physical settings, adjacent land use (existing and planned), types and number of vehicles
anticipated to enter the station, drainage control, the hours of operation and other
pertinent information. If the station is to be used by the general public, the design
shall take account of features which may be needed to accommodate such public use.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

	<h3>17453 Public Health Design Parameters </h3>

<p><i><strong>The station shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize the propagation or
attraction of flies, rodents or other vectors and the creation of nuisances by reason of
solid wastes being deposited at the station. Other factors which shall be taken into
consideration are water and air quality, noise control, odor control, public safety, and
other pertinent matters related to the protection of public health.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2>Personnel </h2>

	<h3>17471 Availability </h3>

<p><i><strong>It is the responsibility of the operator of the station to provide adequate
numbers of qualified personnel to staff the station and deal effectively and promptly with
matters of operation, maintenance, environmental controls, records, emergencies, and
health and safety. In this regard, cross-training and development of standby arrangements
are encouraged</strong>.</i> </p>

<p>During the inspection, the inspector should obtain or make a general list of site
personnel, including the names and titles of key site officials and numbers and types of
personnel by function. After watching a day's operations, the inspector should consider
the daily site tonnage, types and quantities of equipment, and overall site operations to
determine if the number of site personnel is adequate to properly handle all site
operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Failure to comply with SMS
relating to load screening, equipment operations, vector control, litter control, drainage
control, supervision, etc., may be indicative of a violation of this standard. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

	<h3>17472 Training </h3>

<p><i><strong>Personnel assigned to operate the station shall be adequately trained in subjects
pertinent to station operation and maintenance, with emphasis on safety, health,
environmental controls, and emergency procedures.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should ask site supervisors and personnel about the facility's training
programs for operations, maintenance and safety. In addition, training records should be
reviewed. If answers or records are vague and/or if no training program can be documented,
this is an indication that training is a problem. Essential disposal site training should
include personnel safety, hazardous materials recognition and screening, and heavy
equipment operations in waste. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Cal/OSHA Labor Code, Title 8, CCR, Section 64107.7 sets training
requirements for worker safety. Each facility is required to have an Injury and Illness
Prevention Plan (IIPP), which may be referenced for site specific training requirements. </p>

	<h3>17473 Supervision </h3>

<p><i><strong>The station operator shall provide adequate supervision to insure proper
operation of the station in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, permit
conditions and other requirements. The Enforcement Agency, local health entity, and fire
authority shall be kept advised of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
operator, station manager and supervisor.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The LEA and local fire authority must be able to substantiate the knowledge or record
of the information referenced in this standard. The LEA should contact the local fire
authority periodically to verify that the required notification has been made by the
operator. The operator may also choose to notify the appropriate fire authority by mail
and send a copy to the LEA. </p>

<p>The station supervisor should be present at the facility for at least a portion of the
operating day. Supervision is especially important at MRFs which have a hand sorting line.
Responsible supervision includes ensuring that personnel use appropriate health and safety
gear at all times and observe proper safety practices. </p>

<p>The existence of a number of violations of SMS can be indicative of poor supervision
and may be cause for citing a violation of this standard. If a site has a chronic problem
with several operational minimum standards which are related to a lack of proper resource
utilization (staffing and/or equipment), a supervision violation should be given. </p>

	<h3>17474 Site Attendant </h3>

<p><i><strong>Stations which are open to the public shall have an attendant on duty during
operating hours or be visually monitored when determined by the Enforcement Agency to be
necessary to prevent problems of health, fire or safety significance.</strong></i> </p>

<p>If the facility does not have an attendant, the LEA should determine a schedule for
inspection by the operator. The site should be visually monitored by the operator for
problems of cleaning, waste removal, personnel health and safety, scavenging, and other
general operations standards. It is recommended that site personnel be required to monitor
the site at least once per operating day. Board staff also recommend that a written
schedule be established by the LEA and a copy forwarded to the operator and Board. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Signs </h2>

	<h3>17481 Identification Signs </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each point of access from a public road shall be identified by a suitable sign
indicating the name of the station operator. Other pertinent general information may be
required by the Enforcement Agency as approved by the local land use authority.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Encourage the operator to include other data such as the contract operator's name (if
any), telephone number, and the type of facility. This information provides easy
identification for emergency vehicles and the public. </p>

	<h3>17482 Entry Signs </h3>

<p><i><strong>If the station is open to the public, there shall be a sign at an appropriate
point indicating the schedule of charges, hours of operation, and listing the general
types of materials which either (1) WILL be accepted, or (2) WILL NOT be accepted.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this standard is only applicable if the site is open to the public.
The information on the sign should be checked for consistency with the RSI and the SWFP as
well as the actual operating hours and practices. </p>

<h2>Security </h2>

	<h3>17483 Station Security </h3>

<p><i><strong>The station shall have adequate perimeter barrier designed to discourage
unauthorized entry by persons or vehicles. Where water or topographic conditions are such
as to create a similar effect, a barrier is not required. Areas within the site which are
deemed hazardous shall be separately fenced and properly identified to create an adequate
level of security.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Gates should be locked after operating hours. Damaged fencing should be repaired. If
sites are open continuously (24 hours), gates and areas deemed hazardous must be fenced or
kept under surveillance by site attendants. Hazardous areas may include operations which
pose a public safety threat to users of the facility (e.g., glass and metal storage
piles). The inspector should look for signs of illegal entry such as tire tracks which
enter the facility at the site perimeter. </p>

<h2>Roads </h2>

	<h3>17484 Roads </h3>

<p><i><strong>Roads and driveways shall have a reasonably smooth surface which is designed to
minimize the generation of dust and the tracking of material onto adjacent paved public
roads, and shall be constructed to withstand regular and thorough cleaning. Such roads
shall allow vehicles utilizing the station to have reasonable all-weather access to the
station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>If vehicles using the station are observed generating excessive dust (visibly obscuring
vehicles), bottoming-out or getting stuck in ruts or mud, a violation should be
documented. This standard applies only to roads within the permitted facility boundary. </p>

<h2>Visual Screening </h2>

	<h3>17485 Visual Screening </h3>

<p><i><strong>The station shall have appropriate treatment of areas open to public view to
create and maintain an attractive and aesthetically acceptable appearance as approved by
the Enforcement Agency and the local land use authority.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Screening may be in the form of attractive fencing, walls, landscaping or architecture.
</p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Construction </h2>

	<h3>17486 Station Construction </h3>

<p><i><strong>Solid waste storage containers shall be durable, easily cleanable, designed for
safe handling, and constructed to prevent loss of wastes from the equipment during
storage. If such equipment is used to store garbage, other wet or liquid producing wastes,
or wastes composed of fine particles, such equipment shall in all cases be nonabsorbent
and leak-resistant. Unloading areas shall be easily cleanable, designed for safe handling
and constructed to prevent loss of wastes. All equipment shall be in good condition and
cleaned in a frequency and in a manner so as to prevent the propagation or attraction of
flies, rodents, or other vectors and the creation of nuisances.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2>Sanitation </h2>

	<h3>17491 Sanitary Facilities </h3>

<p><i><strong>Adequate sanitary facilities for the station personnel shall be available at the
station or in the immediate vicinity.</strong></i> </p>

<p>For purposes of uniformity, adequate sanitary facilities consist of a sanitary toilet
and handwashing facility with soap. The inspector must use his/her discretion, based on
site-specific conditions to decide what is to be considered the &quot;immediate
vicinity&quot;. </p>

	<h3>17492 Water Supply </h3>

<p><i><strong>Safe and adequate drinking water for the station personnel shall be available.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>The operator should provide the water supply and personnel should not be required to
bring their own water. Employees may forget to bring water and/or weather or unexpected
conditions may require the availability of an additional supply. A city water line,
bottled water, clean water tanks certified structurally sound, or wells tested potable by
the local health agency are acceptable. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As a guideline for testing potability, note that Title 22, � 64411
requires that domestic wells of public water systems serving greater than 25 people at
least 60 days per year, be tested monthly for bacteria and every three years for total
chemicals. </p>

<h2>Communications </h2>

	<h3>17493 Communications Facilities </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each station shall have adequate communications facilities available to the
station personnel.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The use of two-way radios or cellular phones may meet the communication requirement of
this section. The inspector should list the current facility telephone number in the
inspection report and periodically verify that the equipment is operating. </p>

<h2>Lighting </h2>

	<h3>17494 Lighting </h3>

<p><i><strong>Where operations are conducted during hours of darkness, the station and/or
equipment shall be equipped with adequate lighting as approved by the Enforcement Agency
to insure safety, to permit monitoring effectiveness of cleaning operations and for
inspection of loaded transfer vehicles.</strong></i> </p>

<p>A violation should be noted if, as a result of inadequate lighting, site personnel or
the public is endangered or operations can not be conducted in accordance with SMS. Lights
on vehicles, without other sources of light, are not adequate to meet the requirements of
this standard. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Safety </h2>

	<h3>17495 Fire Fighting Equipment </h3>

<p><i><strong>Station personnel shall have properly maintained fire suppression equipment
continuously available in sufficient quantities and located as required by the local fire
authority and Enforcement Agency.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should verify that all fire control equipment such as hoses, sprinkler
systems, fire extinguishers and alarms are fully operational. For fire extinguishers,
check the inspection frequency and the date of last recharge. If an inspector is concerned
with any lack of firefighting equipment, the local fire authority should be informed
within ten business days. </p>

	<h3>17496 Protection of Users </h3>

<p><i><strong>Stations shall be designed, constructed and operated so that contact between
users and solid wastes is minimized. Railing, curbs, grates, fences shall be provided as
necessary to adequately protect the public and station personnel.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Children should be required to remain in vehicles and personnel should continually
monitor the public tipping area and other areas accessible to the public. </p>

<p>Some MRFs allow the public to unload recyclables directly into material processing
areas. Those areas which are open to the public should be free of hazards such as falling
objects, large stacks of recovered materials, equipment, belts, slippery surfaces and loud
noises. The public should not be allowed to linger in the processing areas of the MRF. </p>

	<h3>17497 Personnel Health and Safety </h3>

<p><i><strong>Operating and maintenance personnel shall be required to wear and use approved
safety equipment as determined necessary by the Enforcement Agency.</strong></i> </p>

<p>LEAs should issue requirements for wearing safety equipment and review and revise these
requirements as necessary. This requirement is usually stated in the RFI or SWFP. Approved
safety equipment may include hard hats, gloves, steel-toed and steel-shanked boots, dust
masks, safety vests, and hearing protection. This is especially important for employees
who sort and separate the recoverable materials from the waste stream. If the inspector
determines that LEA-required safety equipment is not in use by site personnel, a violation
should be noted. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Title 8, CCR, enforced by Cal/OSHA, contains personnel health and safety
requirements. If the inspector is aware of a violation of Title 8, Cal/OSHA should be
informed. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Confined Unloading </h2>

	<h3>17511 Confined Unloading </h3>

<p><i><strong>Unloading of solid wastes shall be confined to as small an area as practicable.
Adequate control of windblown materials shall be provided.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The unloading area at a facility should be large enough to handle the peak number of
vehicles using it without causing traffic safety problems, personnel or public safety
hazards, or waiting or stacking up of vehicles. The LEA may require litter fences and
routine litter pickup to adequately control windblown materials at a facility which is
subject to high winds and is not fully enclosed. </p>

<h2>Cleanup </h2>

	<h3>17512 Cleaning </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each station handling an average volume of over 100 cubic yards of waste per day
shall be cleaned daily of all loose materials and litter, or on a schedule approved by the
Enforcement Agency. All boxes, bins, pits or other types of containers used shall be
cleaned on a schedule approved by the Enforcement Agency.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Daily cleaning can best be assessed by observing the condition of the site at the start
of the day's operation. </p>

<h2>Waste Removal </h2>

	<h3>17513 Solid Waste Removal </h3>

<p><i><strong>Any station handling an average volume of over 100 cubic yards of waste per day
shall have any solid wastes deposited at the site removed every 48 hours or in accordance
with an approved operations schedule.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Board staff recommend that waste is removed at a minimum of once every 48 hours, unless
the facility's operations preclude it (e.g., a WTEF which requires a continuous fuel
supply to the combustion chamber). The inspector should verify that waste is removed in
accordance with the approved operations schedule. This may be verified through
weight/volume records and interviews with site personnel. </p>
