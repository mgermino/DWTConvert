<h2>Parking </h2>

<h3>17514 Parking </h3>

<p><i><strong>Uncleaned transfer vehicles containing putrescible materials shall not be parked
on public streets or roads except under emergency conditions. Adequate off-street parking
facilities for transfer vehicles shall be provided.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2>Salvaging/Processing </h2>

<h3>17515 Scavenging </h3>

<p><i><strong>Scavenging shall be prohibited at any station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Scavenging means the uncontrolled and/or unauthorized removal of solid waste materials
(Section 17225.63). Scavenging can be verified by visual observation and/or interviews
with site personnel. </p>

<h3>17516 Salvaging Permitted at Transfer Stations </h3>

<p><i><strong>Recovery of materials, such as metal, paper and glass, is permitted as an
integral part of the operation of a transfer station, subject to conditions established by
the Enforcement Agency, the local land use authority, or other approval agencies.
Salvaging shall not interfere with other aspects of transfer station operation, nor shall
it be conducted so as to interfere with expeditious entry and egress of vehicles
delivering waste to the transfer station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Salvaging means the controlled removal of waste material for utilization (Section
17225.61). Salvaging should be conducted in an area which is safe and separated from
moving equipment. Salvaging operations should be described in the RFI. </p>

<h3>17517 Volume Reduction </h3>

<p><i><strong>Volume reduction operations such as baling or shredding are permitted at a
transfer station provided they are conducted in a controlled manner as an integral part of
the operation and in conformance with conditions established by the Enforcement Agency,
the local land use authority and other approval agencies. Volume reduction activities
shall not interfere with other aspects of station operation and shall be controlled to
minimize health, safety or nuisance problems.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should look for potential fire hazards from salvaged materials, including
cardboard, newspaper, and magazine piles. In addition, the inspector should watch for
safety hazards to equipment operators and problems associated with dust, noise, vectors,
leachate and standing water. </p>

<h3>17518 Processing Area </h3>

<p><i><strong>Salvaging and volume reduction shall be confined to specified, clearly identified
areas of the transfer station.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Salvaging and volume reduction areas should be located so that problems do not result
from traffic or commingling and/or contamination of salvaged materials. Users of the
facility should be able to easily locate the appropriate salvaged materials drop-off
area(s). </p>

<h3>17519 Processing Operations </h3>

<p><i><strong>Waste processing activities conducted at the station shall be conducted in an
organized manner and shall be controlled to minimize health, safety or nuisance problems.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>The inspector should look for overflowing piles of glass, cardboard, metals, etc., and
excessive buildup of waste or litter near baling machines which can create safety
problems. The manner in which waste processing personnel conduct operations should be
observed for actions which may result in health and safety problems. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h3>17520 Storage of Salvage </h3>

<p><i><strong>Salvaged materials generated on-site or imported shall be placed from storage
away from other activity areas and be limited to a volume as approved by the Enforcement
Agency, local land use authority or other approval agencies which (1) minimizes the
harborage or attraction of flies, rodents or other vectors and the creation of nuisances
and (2) minimizes the risk of fire or other hazards.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should be aware of potential hazards from improper storage of salvaged
materials, including health effects from containers contaminated with food, combustion of
paper products, and injuries to personnel or the public from sharp glass and metals. In
addition, materials stacked too high may be unstable and could result in crushing
injuries. Tin cans, aluminum, cardboard, newspapers, glass, etc., all have the potential
of creating problems related to this standard. </p>

<h3>17521 Removal </h3>

<p><i><strong>Storage of materials salvaged from solid wastes shall be ancillary to the
operation of the station unless such storage is planned as an integral part of the
operation. The maximum storage time shall be limited to a duration which will not result
in health or fire problems.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Stored salvaged materials such as ferrous metal, cardboard, aluminum, and glass should
not cause health or fire problems, nor should they be allowed to pile so high that they
become a physical threat to site personnel and patrons. The operator should be able to
document a reasonable removal frequency, usually through a contract with a salvager. The
removal frequency should be based on the type and volume of material, whether storage of
salvaged materials interfere with operations, and the location of the facility. If there
is no removal contract, there is probably a violation of this standard. </p>

<h3>17522 Non-Salvageable Items </h3>

<p><i><strong>Drugs, cosmetics, foods, beverages, hazardous chemicals, poisons, medical wastes,
syringes, needles, pesticides and other similar materials capable of impairing public
health shall not be salvaged unless approved by the Enforcement Agency and the local
health entity.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2>Nuisance </h2>

<h3>17531 Nuisance Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>Each station shall be operated and maintained so as not to create a public
nuisance.</strong></i> </p>

<p>� 17225.45 states: &quot;Nuisance&quot; includes anything which is injurious to human
health or is indecent or offensive to the senses and interferes with the comfortable
enjoyment of life and property, and affects at the same time an entire community or
neighborhood or any considerable number of persons although the extent of annoyance or
damage inflicted upon the individual may be unequal and which occurs as a result of the
storage, removal, transport, processing or disposal of solid waste. </p>

<p>A facility should be considered in violation of this standard if a major nuisance,
other than dust, litter or odor (which are already covered by other standards) is
observed. This standard may be used to address a noise nuisance since 17536 - Noise, only
addresses health hazards from noise. In addition, a glare nuisance may be addressed under
this standard. If a nuisance is related to water quality, the appropriate RWQCB should be
informed. An example would be receipt of a complaint of odor or color changes observed in
water from domestic wells which may have occurred as a result of facility operations. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Dust </h2>

<h3>17532 Dust Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>The operator shall take adequate measures to minimize the creation of dust.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>Throughout the inspection, the inspector should visually evaluate dust control. If
excessive dust is observed and the operator has taken no steps to control it (e.g.,
overhead sprinkler), the facility is violating this section. Dust is excessive when it
obscures visibility, irritates eyes, hampers breathing and coats equipment and personnel.
Dust control measures should be described in the RFI. </p>

<p>An area of concern should be noted if the site has numerous violations concerning dust
control issued by the Air Pollution Control District (APCD) or Air Quality Management
District (AQMD) and/or a recent history of citizen complaints, even if the inspector does
not observe a violation of this standard during the inspection. </p>

<p>The inspector should be aware of fugitive dust problems at MRFs. Fugitive dust is
composed of dust and fine particulates that arise from mechanized operations. These
particles become suspended in the air and then escape the premises through the movement of
the air. Fugitive dust is common at MRFs and may be seen as fine coatings of dust on
plants or structures outside the facility or property boundary. </p>

<p>One of the most common methods of dust control at transfer stations and MRFs is to use
an overhead sprinkler or misting system to wash/wet down facility equipment and/or the
waste stream during operations. This may cause other problems such as slippery floors,
large amounts of contaminated washwater which must be adequately handled, and
contamination of materials which are being salvaged (e.g., cardboard and paper). The
inspector should confirm that any dust control system is functioning properly and does not
cause additional problems at the site. </p>

<h2>Vectors/Birds </h2>

<h3>17533 Vector and Bird Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>The operator shall take adequate steps to control or prevent the propagation,
harborage or attraction of flies, rodents or other vectors and to minimize bird problems.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>Populations of birds, mosquitoes, and other insects or animals which can transmit
disease to humans must be prevented or controlled. The operator of a facility with bird
problems should be encouraged to use the wire/grid system after consultation with the
Department of Fish and Game. Nuisance problems concerning the migration of birds from a
facility to nearby residences should be addressed under this standard. In addition, bird
problems may include the propagation, harborage or attraction of birds that are natural
enemies of endangered or threatened species that are endemic to the area surrounding a
site (e.g., desert sites where ravens, a natural enemy of the desert tortoise, are
attracted to landfills). </p>

<p>An inspector should consider a site to be in violation of this section if excessive
numbers of adult flies are present or if immature stages of flies or mosquitoes (larvae or
pupae) are observed developing to the adult stage on site. It is a good indication that
flies or mosquitoes are excessive if the inspector is bothered by them while walking
around the site. If clusters or groupings of flies are seen on fences, walls, vehicles or
other lower attractant areas, there is a fly problem. </p>

<p>If a live rat is seen at the facility during the inspection, this is an indication that
more rats exist and that there may be a rat problem. Active rat burrows or fresh droppings
also indicate a rat problem. Also, many ground squirrel burrows near the facility are an
indication that these rodents are filling the rat's niche. These rodents can act as
disease vectors. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Drainage/Erosion </h2>

<h3>17534 Drainage Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>Drainage shall be handled as specified in the station design, unless an
alternative method which achieves the design objectives is approved by the Enforcement
Agency. Drainage leaving the station shall not contain solids, wash water or leachate
emanating from solid wastes. Placement of drainage or cleanup water in a sanitary sewer
shall be prohibited unless approved by the local sewerage authorities. Drainage control
should be coordinated with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.</strong></i> </p>

<p>When appropriate, the RWQCB and Department of Fish and Game should be alerted if
existing drainage structures for run-on and run-off are overflowing, plugged or otherwise
inoperative, or when substantial amounts of sediment are observed leaving the site and
entering waterways. Sediment from erosion can also be harmful to fish in waterways. The
adequacy of the drainage structures may be determined by comparing them with the design
specified in the RFI and should be verified with the RWQCB. The inspector should look for
erosion that undermines roads and structures causing a potential safety hazard or
threatens the integrity of control systems. If problems are noted, Closure and Remediation
Branch staff can provide technical assistance in the review of drainage and erosion
design. </p>

<h2>Litter </h2>

<h3>17535 Litter Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>Litter and loose materials shall be routinely collected and disposed of properly.
The collection frequency shall be set with the objective of preventing the accumulation of
quantities which are aesthetically objectionable or cause other problems. The Enforcement
Agency shall periodically monitor the effectiveness of the litter control program.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>A litter violation exists if litter has blown off-site in objectionable quantities or
is allowed to accumulate excessively on-site (i.e., piling up on fences, against
buildings, vehicles, and the loading bay). </p>

<h2>Noise </h2>

<h3>17536 Noise Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>Noise shall be controlled to prevent health hazards to persons using the station
and to nearby residents.</strong></i> </p>

<p>A violation of this standard should be noted if noise in any area of the permitted site
is hazardous (can cause hearing damage) to persons using the site or to residents living
nearby. </p>

<p>This standard does not apply to site personnel. Concerns regarding noise hazards to
site personnel should be referred to Cal/OSHA's Department of Occupational Safety and
Health. Although noise standards enforced by Cal/OSHA (Table 1) apply exclusively to site
personnel, Board staff recommend that these levels be referenced when making a noise
hazard determination under this standard. When unsafe noise levels are suspected at a
facility, the LEA may request that Board staff evaluate noise levels at the site.
Measurements of noise levels will be performed with a Sound Level Meter. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Title 8 noise standards, enforced by Cal/OSHA, require the employer to
administer a &quot;Hearing Conservation Program&quot; if an employee is exposed to the
action level [continuous 8 hours at 85 dBA (Time-Weighted Average)]. In this case, hearing
protectors should be made available to site personnel. Cal/OSHA standards are listed in <strong>Table
1</strong>. Site personnel should not be exposed to impulsive or impact noise that exceeds a
peak sound pressure level of 140 dBA. </p>

<h2>Odor </h2>

<h3>17537 Odor Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>The station shall not be a source of odor nuisances.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Odors are excessive if they are detected at objectionable levels to the inspector at a
property boundary which is bordered by residences or other sensitive receptors. Odors may
indicate the presence of decomposition gases and should be checked with a combustible gas
indicator (CGI). These facilities do not usually have sufficient quantities of waste to
create a problem with decomposition gas. </p>

<p>Chronically excessive odors should be brought to the attention of the appropriate air
quality agency (AQMD, APCD, or ARB). An area of concern should be noted if the site has
had numerous odor violations issued by the APCD or AQMD and/or a recent history of citizen
complaints, but the inspector does not observe a violation of this standard during the
inspection. </p>

<h2>Traffic </h2>

<h3>17538 Traffic Control </h3>

<p><i><strong>Traffic flow into, on and out of the station shall be in accord with the design
intent and in such a manner so as to minimize interference and safety problems for traffic
on adjacent public streets or roads. Specifically, stacking of vehicles waiting to enter
the station on public streets or roads may only occur as approved by local traffic
engineering and police authorities.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Concerns regarding off-site vehicle stacking should be referred to the local traffic
authority, planning department, or police. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Equipment </h2>

<h3>17546 General </h3>

<p><i><strong>Equipment shall be adequate in type, capacity and numbers to permit the station
operation to meet all requirements of these standards. Equipment shall be maintained so as
to consistently perform the work for which it is intended, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should make a note of any large-scale station equipment such as
skip-loaders, balers, trommels, conveyors, etc. If such equipment is inoperable and
operations suffer as a result of malfunction, it is a violation of this standard. During
the inspection, the inspector should attempt to judge the overall maintenance level of the
facility. Equipment breakdowns may indicate an overall maintenance problem. </p>

<h3>17547 Standby Equipment </h3>

<p><i><strong>Specific units of standby equipment are not required, providing the operator
maintains an up-to-date list of firms or agencies which can supply needed and adequate
replacement units within a reasonable period of time.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h3>17548 Transfer Vehicles </h3>

<p><i><strong>Transfer vehicles shall be adequately covered and constructed of durable and
easily cleanable materials.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should observe transfer vehicles entering and exiting the station and
note whether wastes fall from the vehicles as well as how adequately the vehicles are
covered to prevent loss of wastes at higher speeds. </p>

<h3>17549 Inspection of Equipment </h3>

<p><i><strong>Equipment used for transport of solid wastes shall be made available for
inspection as requested by the appropriate Enforcement Agency.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Although an LEA is not required to inspect vehicles during each monthly inspection, the
equipment must be made available upon request. Vehicles used for the collection and
transport of refuse must meet the requirements of �� 17341- 17344. </p>

<h3>17550 Housekeeping </h3>

<p><i><strong>A high standard of housekeeping is required in the maintenance of station
equipment. Accumulations of fuel drums, parts, inoperable equipment, tires, scrap and
similar items must be minimized unless reasonably screened from outside the station
boundary.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h2>Maintenance </h2>

<h3>17556 General </h3>

<p><i><strong>Effective preventive maintenance procedures and programs for equipment and
station facilities shall be developed and utilized.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance at this time. </p>

<h3>17557 Station Maintenance Program </h3>

<p><i><strong>The operator shall frequently monitor and promptly repair or correct deteriorated
or defective conditions with respect to requirements of these standards and conditions
established by the Enforcement Agency or other approval agencies.</strong></i> </p>

<p>No further guidance. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h2>Special Wastes </h2>

<h3>17561 Burning Wastes </h3>

<p><i><strong>If burning wastes are received, they shall be deposited in a safe area and
extinguished. A safe area is defined as being away from unloading, processing and transfer
areas, structures on adjacent properties and other fire hazard areas. The operator shall
seek advice and concurrence from local fire authorities regarding safe areas and means of
extinguishing burning wastes.</strong></i> </p>

<p>The inspector should note a violation if there is a fire at the site or a hot load
(smoldering ashes) is received and the above procedures are not followed. In these cases,
the local fire authority should be informed. Observations regarding discharges of liquid
from fire extinguishing should be brought to the attention of the RWQCB. </p>

<h3>17562 Hazardous Wastes </h3>

<p><i><strong>Hazardous wastes may be accepted only if specifically authorized by the
Enforcement Agency and in the manner approved by that agency. A transfer/processing
station handling hazardous waste shall comply with Division 4, Chapter 2, Title 22,
California Administrative Code.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Hazardous wastes that are received and separated from the waste stream must be handled
with the proper precautions to protect site personnel, the public, or animals, until
disposed of properly. Proper precautions include adequate packaging, labeling and secure
storage until removal, appropriate personal protective equipment and adequate personnel
decontamination facilities. Illegal receipt or storage of hazardous waste should be
brought to the attention of the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) or the local
agency which is responsible for the implementation of the hazardous waste program. Some
examples of hazardous waste that may be found at a transfer station, MRF, or WTEF include
used motor oil, latex and solvent-based paints, paint thinners, batteries, antifreeze,
waste containing more than 1% friable asbestos, medical waste, and other household
hazardous wastes. </p>

<p><i>Oil: </i>Concerns regarding oil storage and spillage should be brought to the
attention of the appropriate agency (DTSC and/or RWQCB). </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Up to 5,000 gallons of used oil may be legally stored for up to 90 days
with proper secondary containment without having a permit as a hazardous waste storage
facility in accordance with Health and Safety Code, � 25123.3. Tank systems must comply
with secondary containment requirements of Title 22, � 66265.193, unless exempted in
accordance with � 66265.193(g) or granted a variance under � 66265.193(g). </p>

<p>Used oil filters may be managed as non-hazardous waste only if the conditions set forth
in Title 22, � 66266.130 are met. </p>

<p><i>Batteries:</i> If a hazardous waste facilities permit is issued to the facility by
the DTSC, batteries should be stored in accordance with its requirements. A hazardous
waste facilities permit may not be required if: up to one ton of used lead-acid batteries
(approximately 50 batteries) are stored for a maximum of one year or <i>more </i>than one
ton of such batteries are stored for up to 180 days, in accordance with Health and Safety
Code section 25218.8 <a HREF="23attd.htm#D">(Appendix D)</a>. For estimating purposes, the
industry standard is 40 pounds per battery. All batteries should be stored in accordance
with Title 22 requirements. </p>

<p>If hazardous waste is seen on the tipping floor or other unpermitted areas of the site,
it is a violation unless it is also seen by the operator who then takes appropriate
action. </p>

<p>When illegal hazardous waste is discovered, the operator should isolate the material
and contact the appropriate county health hazardous materials unit. The operator should
attempt to determine the source of the material. Many facilities have hazardous waste
storage units, and if the waste does not present an immediate threat, it should be
properly stored in accordance with Title 22 requirements, at this location. </p>

<h3>17563 Infectious Wastes </h3>

<p><i><strong>No infectious waste shall be processed through a transfer/processing station
unless adequately preprocessed to eliminate any hazard.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Medical waste, as defined under California's Medical Waste Management Act, is not
allowed at transfer/processing stations. When medical waste is discovered, the operator
should contact the agency responsible for administering the Medical Waste Management Act,
generally the LEA. Properly treated medical waste which is rendered non-infectious and
deemed solid waste may be accepted. Properly treated medical waste will generally be
contained within a red plastic biohazard bag or an autoclave bag with heat indicator tape
on it. The operator's loadchecking plan should address medical waste. </p>

<p><a href="23atta.htm"><strong>Table of Contents</strong></a></p>

<h3>17564 Liquid Wastes </h3>

<p><i><strong>Liquid wastes and sludges may not be accepted at a station unless the station and
transfer vehicles are properly equipped to handle such wastes as authorized by the
Enforcement Agency, the local health entity, and if applicable, the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board.</strong></i> </p>

<p>Liquid wastes which may be accepted at a transfer station, MRF, or WTEF, should be
specifically described in the SWFP and RFI. A violation should be noted if unpermitted or
prohibited liquid wastes or sludges are accepted. </p>

<p>Concerns associated with liquid wastes, other than water quality, including odors,
nuisance, and handling, should be addressed in the RFI and SWFP. </p>
