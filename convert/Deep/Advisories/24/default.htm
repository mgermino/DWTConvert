<p>This LEA advisory has been developed to clarify any confusion that has existed
regarding when five-year permit reviews are due for full permits.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&amp;group=44001-45000&amp;file=44001-44018">Public
Resources Code (PRC) �44015</a>
and California Code of Regulation (CCR) <a href="/Laws/Regulations/Title27/ch4s123a.htm#21640">Title
27, Section 21640</a> set the requirement that any Solid Waste Facility Permit (permit) issued or revised shall be reviewed at least once every five
years. There has been confusion as to when the five year period is calculated from,
either the date of issuance of the permit, or the completion of last five year permit
review. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=prc&amp;group=44001-45000&amp;file=44001-44018">PRC
�44015</a> and CCR <a href="/Laws/Regulations/Title27/ch4s123a.htm#21640">Title
27, Section 21640</a> both state that any permit issued or revised shall be
reviewed or revised at least once every five years. The law and regulation both
imply that a revision is equivalent to a permit review. A revision will be
considered to be equivalent to a five-year permit review. In the case of a full
permit, a copy of the permit review
report that has been prepared in the last 5 years, should be included with every application package for revision submitted to the
Board. You may refer to <a href="../21/default.htm"> LEA Advisory #21</a> for guidance on how to complete five-year
permit review reports. </p>

<p>Five year permit reviews will be due five years from the date of the last review or
revision, whichever is later, as the law and regulation require. The date of
revision will be considered to be the issuance date of the permit. Following are
examples of several permits, and guidance for determining when the five-year permit
reviews are due. 

<ol>
  <li>A permit was issued in 1985, revised in 1987, and a five year permit review report was
    completed in 1991 indicating no revision was needed. The permit will be due for
    review in 1996. </li>
  <li>A five year permit review was completed in 1992 indicating a revision was necessary, and
    a revised permit was not issued until 1993. The permit will be due for review in
    1998. </li>
  <li>A permit was issued in 1989, and was revised in 1993. The permit will be due for
    review in 1998. </li>
  <li>Permit &quot;modifications&quot; have since been replaced by the permit
    &quot;revision&quot; process. </li>
  <li>A permit was issued in 1984, and a five-year permit review was completed in 1989
    indicating that a revision was necessary. In 1994, the permit still had not been
    revised. A five-year permit review should be conducted in 1994 because the law states the
    permit shall be reviewed or revised at least once every five years. The permit
    review report in this case should place emphasis on why the revision was not completed in
    a timely manner. </li>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide guidance to 
Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties. Guidance, for this 
purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s regulations and 
statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement 
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as 
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking 
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">
11340.5</a>
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">
