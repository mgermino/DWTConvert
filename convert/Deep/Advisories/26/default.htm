    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong></p>

<p>LEA's have been advised to issue permits for excavations of solid waste or to list such
activity as a permitted use based on the assumption that disturbance of waste was
tantamount to an active landfilling activity. &nbsp;Excavation takes place at active
landfills to make room for new waste, to redesign cells, or for corrective reasons. Where
excavation has been undertaken at a closed site, or a CIA site, where no current permit
exists, this same principle of requiring a permit for such activity has been applied. </p>

<p>There is also the perception that protection of health, safety, and the environment can
only be achieved through the issuance of a Solid Waste Facilities Permit (permit). </p>

<p>This has led to questions from operators, LEA's and permits branch staff alike
concerning imposing a permit on an activity NOT associated with active landfilling, and
where other orders, plans and local permits are already controlling the project
necessitating the excavation. &nbsp;<strong>No separate permit for excavating a landfill should
be issued</strong>. </p>

<p>Active permitted landfills, should include new excavation activities in the permit.
&nbsp;The permit should be modified or revised, or the RDSI can be amended, whichever is
appropriate. </p>

<p>In landfills which are certified closed under current requirements, excavation shall be
regulated by the closure and postclosure maintenance plan or an approved postclosure land
use plan. </p>

<p>CIA landfills, and landfills closed prior to the adoption of the current regulations,
that are excavating waste (for remedial action, clean closure, etc.), should regulate
excavation by a noticed or stipulated order, contract and/or approved workplan or other
document/mechanism containing the specifications for the work to be done. </p>

<p>If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact your Permits
Branch representative. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide guidance to 
Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties. Guidance, for this 
purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s regulations and 
statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement 
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as 
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking 
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">
11340.5</a>
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">
