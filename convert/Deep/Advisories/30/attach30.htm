	<h2>I.&nbsp;<a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
</h2>

<p>The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)
developed the Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) Equipment Loan Program (loan
program)
to support LEA equipment needs and to fulfill the requirements of Public
Resources Code (PRC), Section 43217 which states: “The board shall provide
ongoing training, technical assistance, and guidance to enforcement agencies to
assist in their decision-making processes.” 
This assistance includes a program for loaning technical and scientific
equipment, to the extent that funds are available to the CIWMB to purchase that
equipment.”</p>

<p>Additionally,
the program was developed to support LEAs whose financial or technical
resources limit their ability to obtain and operate instrumentation and other
technical and scientific equipment.</p>

<p>The
specific goals of this loan program are to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Provide
a reliable supply of calibrated instrumentation and other technical and
scientific equipment for loan to LEAs.</li>
  <li> Provide
training and technical support to LEAs.</li>
  <li> Encourage
LEAs to adopt and use standardized equipment.</li>
  <li> Ensure
all loaned equipment meets acceptable levels of quality control and quality
assurance.</li>
  <li> Reduce
cost by centralizing maintenance and repair for field equipment.</li>
  <li> Increase
support and cooperation between CalRecycle and LEAs for field activities.</li>
</ol>

<h2>II.&nbsp;<a name="Responsibilities">Responsibilities</a>
