    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong></p>

<p><strong>November 21, 1996&nbsp;</strong> </p>

<p><strong>To: &nbsp;County
Environmental Health Directors and Certified Unified Program Agencies</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Subject: &nbsp;Management of Recalled
Mini-Blinds</strong> </p>

<p>Vinyl mini-blinds were recently recalled due to the presence of lead that can be
hazardous to children. Children are vulnerable to lead exposure from mini-blinds if
they touch the blinds and then put their hands in their mouths, or if they put the
mini-blinds in their mouths directly. </p>

<p>In a fact sheet following the recall action, the California Department of Health
Services (DHS) advised consumers to dispose of their vinyl mini-blinds with their
household trash. On July 16, 1996 the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC)
issued a letter to all County Environmental Health Directors requesting them to advise the
public not to dispose of mini-blinds in the household trash until DTSC completed and
analysis of the mini-blinds' lead concentration and evaluated the risk they might pose to
public health and the environment if disposed of in an ordinary landfill. </p>

<p>DTSC has completed its analysis of the mini-blinds. The results show that the
mini-blinds that were tested contain lead in concentrations that would categorize them as
hazardous waste. After evaluating the hazardous characteristics of the recalled
mini-blinds, DTSC concludes that the public is more at risk if mini-blinds are left in the
homes than if they are disposed of in a non-hazardous landfill.&nbsp;Handling the
recalled mini-blinds as hazardous waste would only hinder their rapid removal from homes.
Thus, given the physical state of lead in the mini-blinds, it would pose a minimal
risk to the environment if they are placed in plastic bags and disposed of in household
trash to non-hazardous solid waste landfills. </p>

<p>Anyone contacting your office for guidance regarding disposal of lead containing
mini-blinds should be advised that although DTSC encourages these mini-blinds to be
disposed of at local household hazardous waste collection events, they may be placed in
plastic bags and disposed of with household trash. </p>

<p>The process described in this letter does not apply to waste mini-blinds from sources
other than households or residential buildings. The mini-blinds tested are
characteristic hazardous waste under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA). Therefore, mini-blinds from businesses must be disposed as hazardous waste
unless exempt under federal law. If the business generates less than 100 kg. of
hazardous waste (mini-blinds plus any other hazardous waste generated on site) in a single
calendar month, then by federal law the business would be classified as a Conditionally
Exempt Small Quantity Generator. DTSC will allow only businesses that qualify as
Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators to dispose of their waste blinds at a
non-hazardous landfill. </p>

<p>Both the Chief of the Division of Clean Water Programs of the State Water Resources
Control Board and the Deputy Director of the Permitting and Enforcement Division of the
California Integrated Waste Management Board have concurred with DTSC's approach.
For more information about the proper disposal of these mini-blinds, please contact
Dr. Sangat Kals of DTSC at (916) 324-8293. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>
