<p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong> </p>

<p>The purpose of this LEA Advisory is to provide guidance on the issuance of emergency
waivers of standards as allowed under Title 14, California Code of Regulations (14 CCR),
Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 3, Section 17210 et seq., Emergency Waiver of Standards.
A copy of the regulations is included as <a HREF="AttachmentA.htm">Attachment A</a>.
(Please note that the attached regulations are an unofficial version of the
regulations. The authoritative regulations are found in Barclays Official California
Code of Regulations published by Barclays Law Publishers.) </p>

	<h2><strong>Background</strong> </h2>

<p>Immediately following a major disaster the cleanup effort and reconstruction often
results in a need to handle more and different types of debris than existing solid waste
facility permits allow. In the past, to assist in the recovery phase of a disaster, the
California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) has issued emergency regulations on a
case-by-case (disaster-by-disaster) basis. These emergency regulations waived
certain standards of a solid waste facility permit (e.g., origin of waste, maximum daily
tonnage, hours of facility operation) to facilitate the cleanup effort. </p>

<p>The Emergency Waiver of Standards regulations became effective in September 1996 and
take the place of the disaster-by-disaster emergency regulations. The permanent
regulations were developed to enable enforcement agencies (EA) to respond quickly to
solid waste facility operation issues and problems after a disaster. </p>

	<h2><strong>What Is an Emergency Waiver of Standards?</strong> </h2>

<p>An emergency waiver of standards is a waiver issued by an enforcement agency which
grants a solid waste facility operator temporary relief from specific state minimum
standards or specific terms or conditions of a solid waste facility permit. More
specifically, an enforcement agency may approve and issue a waiver for the express purpose
of enabling an operator of an existing permitted solid waste facility or locally
approved
temporary transfer or processing site to accept disaster debris and other nonhazardous
wastes, in a manner not consistent with the terms and conditions of the relevant solid
waste facility permit, during the recovery phase of a state of emergency or local
emergency. </p>

	<h2><strong>When May an Emergency Waiver of Standards Be Issued?</strong> </h2>

<p>An emergency waiver of standards may only be issued when there has been a proclamation
of a state of emergency or local emergency as those terms are defined in the regulations.
The definitions of local emergency and state of emergency are included under 14 CCR
17210.1 (j) and (k), respectively.&nbsp;Generally, a state or local emergency is the duly
proclaimed existence of conditions of disaster or extreme peril to the safety of persons
and property. The proclamation must be made by the governor (state of emergency) or
governing body (or duly designated official) of a county, city and county, or city (local
emergency). </p>

<p>Furthermore, an emergency waiver may only be issued to an operator of an existing,
permitted solid waste facility or locally approved temporary transfer or processing sites.
</p>

	<h2><strong>Which State Minimum Standards and Permit Conditions May Be Waived?</strong> 
	</h2>

<p>The waiver can apply only to specified state minimum solid waste standards or to
specific terms or conditions of a solid waste facility permit which are related to the
following:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>Origin of waste; </li>
  <li>Rate of inflow for storage, transfer, processing, or disposal of waste; </li>
  <li>Type and moisture content of solid waste; </li>
  <li>Hours of facility operation; and </li>
  <li>Storage time before transfer, processing, or disposal of nonhazardous waste. </li>
</ul>

<p>Significantly, the standards, terms, and/or conditions that may be waived are those
related to the increased volume and type of waste that may be generated by a disaster
and/or the recovery operations after a disaster. The intent of the waiver is to
enable an operator to handle the increased volumes of waste without creating public health
and safety or environmental problems. For this reason the waiver is limited in scope to
the areas listed above, and all other state minimum standards and permit terms and
conditions shall remain in effect. </p>

<p>In particular, the waiver of the daily cover requirement is not permitted within the
emergency waiver of standards. However, under the authority granted to California
under the Federal Subtitle D regulations, the Board (issuance has been delegated to the
Deputy Director, Permitting and Enforcement Division), jointly with the EA, may approve a
daily cover waiver (14 CCR 17258.21 [c]) if there are extreme seasonal climatic conditions
that make complying with the daily cover requirement impractical. A separate
advisory describing this waiver in more detail has been issued as <a HREF="../40/default.htm">LEA Advisory
#40</a>. </p>

<p>Please note that the emergency waiver is not intended to allow carte blanche operation
of a solid waste facility with respect to state minimum standards and permit conditions.
Therefore, an emergency waiver should only be granted when absolutely necessary and
should only be issued for those particular standards or conditions necessary to enable a
facility to handle disaster related debris. For example, during the January 1997
floods, few waivers were granted and many of those waivers were for only one condition
(i.e., exceeding the daily tonnage listed in the permit). </p>

	<h2><strong>How Long Does a Waiver Remain In Effect?</strong> </h2>

<p>The effective period of a waiver, once granted by an EA, shall not exceed 120 days
initially. The EA may extend the effective period of the waiver, as necessary, to assist
in the recovery from an emergency. Each extension should not be longer than 120 days
and should only extend as long as absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>Prior to the expiration date, a waiver may be modified, canceled, or revoked by an EA
without advance notice should the EA determine that any of the following conditions
occur:&nbsp; 

<ol>
  <li>The use of a waiver will cause or contribute to a public health and safety or
    environmental problem; </li>
  <li>The terms of the waiver are not being used expressly to handle the state of emergency or
    local emergency and are not in the best interest of the public health and safety; </li>
  <li>The waiver is no longer necessary; or </li>
  <li>The operator is not utilizing disaster debris diversion programs to the extent feasible.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While the necessity for a waiver may be for longer than 120 days, depending on the
disaster (emergency), the waiver should be revoked as soon as it is no longer necessary or
appropriate. </p>

	<h2><strong>How Does an EA Issue an Emergency Waiver?</strong> </h2>

<p>Following are the procedures for issuance of a waiver. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Operator Request </p>
  <p>An operator may apply for a waiver after a disaster or emergency situation is declared.
  To obtain a waiver, a solid waste facility operator shall submit a written request to the
  EA. The request shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: <ol>
    <li>A listing of the permit terms and conditions and state minimum standards to be waived in
      order to facilitate recovery and disposal of disaster debris; </li>
    <li>A statement of the remaining disposal capacity of the solid waste disposal site; </li>
    <li>A description of all facility-related diversion programs and onsite recycling
      facilities; and </li>
    <li>A listing of locally approved temporary transfer or processing sites to be used to store
      disaster debris for future reuse or recycling. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples of operator requests and EA approvals are included as <a href="#AttachmentB">Attachment
B</a>. </p>

<p><strong>EA Issuance</strong> </p>

<p>The EA may grant a waiver upon making the following findings: &nbsp; 

<ol>
  <li>The operator applying for the waiver holds a valid solid waste facility permit (or is
    legally operating a locally-approved temporary transfer or processing site); </li>
  <li>The waiver will not pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment; </li>
  <li>The operator identifies and implements, to the extent feasible, diversion programs to
    maximize diversion through reuse, recycling, or composting of disaster-related waste; and </li>
  <li>The EA's jurisdiction is covered by the proclamation of the governor, governing body, or
    duly designated official.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>

<p>The EA must notify the operator within seven (7) days of receipt of the waiver request
whether the waiver has been granted or denied.&nbsp;If denied the EA shall include the
reasons for the denial in the notification. The operator may reapply for a waiver at
a later date or submit necessary supplemental documentation to receive a waiver
immediately, if appropriate. </p>

<p>Board staff are available for consultation and assistance when reviewing operators'
requests for waivers. General questions on the issuance of emergency waivers should
be directed to the Permitting and Enforcement Division Disaster Response Coordinator
(Michael B. Wochnick) at (916) 341-6318. Site specific concerns should be discussed
with the appropriate Enforcement Branch contact. </p>

<p><strong>Board Review</strong> </p>

<p>The Board's Deputy Director, Permitting and Enforcement Division reviews all EA waiver
approvals. Moreover, the waivers may be conditioned, limited, suspended, or terminated by
the Deputy Director if (1) the use of the waiver would cause harm to public health and
safety or the environment, (2) the operator has not utilized reasonably available waste
diversion programs as identified in the waiver documentation, or (3) the waiver was issued
for standards and/or conditions not permitted under the regulations. </p>

<p>A determination under condition no. 2 above is a judgment call. For example, a
waiver would likely be disallowed if an operator made no effort to divert readily
recyclable materials even though diversion facilities are already in place, especially
since temporary storage sites can be used to store surplus materials until they can be
processed. </p>

	<h2><strong>What Are the Reporting Requirements?</strong> </h2>

<p>Following are the reporting requirements under the waiver regulations: </p>

<p><strong>Operator</strong> </p>

<p>The operator shall submit a written report to the EA (and to the local agency
responsible for compiling disposal information from haulers and operators, which is
usually the county unless a regional agreement is in force) every 90 days from the
effective date of a waiver until either (1) the termination of the waiver or (2) there is
no longer any discernible disaster related waste being processed or stored at the
facility, whichever is later. </p>

<p>The written report shall include the following information: &nbsp; 

<ol>
  <li>The daily amount of disaster debris received, diverted, and disposed at the facility; </li>
  <li>The jurisdiction of origin for the disaster debris received at the facility; </li>
  <li>The increase in tonnage of waste received during the waiver period; and </li>
  <li>The facilities used to process the disaster debris.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Enforcement Agency</strong> </p>

<p>The EA shall submit a copy to the Board of all approved waivers within 15 days of
issuance and all operator's written reports within 30 days of receipt and should notify
the Board of termination of the waiver. </p>

<p><strong>Board</strong> </p>

<p>The Executive Director (or designee) shall report to the Board at a regularly scheduled
meeting any granting of a waiver. </p>

	<h2><strong>Are There Any Other Disaster Related Duties of the EA?</strong> </h2>

<p>In the event of a state of emergency or local emergency, the EA is also required to
provide to local government a list of solid waste facilities, which have been granted a
waiver. The list shall include the site capacity for acceptance of waste, daily
tonnage limits, hours of operation, and onsite recycling and diversion for
disaster-related waste. Usually, this information should be provided to the local
emergency services office. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the EA is required to survey solid waste facilities and determine the
diversion programs available and to make this information available to local government
and the public. </p>

<p>Should you have any questions or comments concerning this advisory, please contact
the <a href="../../CountyAssign.asp">Permitting and LEA Support staff</a>
