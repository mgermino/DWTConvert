<h3>&nbsp;1. Health &amp; Safety Training&nbsp; 

</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Annual asbestos recognition training.</strong> Board staff are provided with a 2 hour
    health and safety training emphasizing asbestos recognition. The training covers asbestos
    mineral types and physical properties; health effects of asbestos; detection,
    identification, and assessment of ACM; options for controlling ACM; relevant federal and
    state regulations; and asbestos waste management. The training has been provided by a
    consultant that maintains AHERA and Industrial Hygiene certification. (Note: &nbsp;The
    training met EPA AHERA requirements - Training should meet regulatory requirements of CCR,
    T8, Section 5208, Asbestos) Past training has included mock dress out drills for asbestos
    sampling. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Respiratory protection training.</strong> Board staff are provided with annual respiratory
    protection training. This training covers classifications, description and limitations of
    respirators; selection of respirators; use of respirators, maintenance of respirators; and
    provides quantitative fit testing of respiratory protection. (Training meets regulatory
    requirements of CCR, T8, Section 5144, Respiratory Protective Equipment.)&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>General health and safety field training.</strong> Board staff are required to take an
    initial 40 hours health and safety recognition training. This training reviews
    occupational hazards, hazard controls, personal protection, principles of air monitoring,
    hazard assessment and control, and emergency response. Annually staff are required to
    attend an 8-hour refresher training course reviewing the above material. (Training meets
    Board policy and meets regulatory requirements of CCR, T8, Section 3203, Injury, Illness
    Protection Program and CCR, T8, Section 5192, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency
    Response.)&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Medical Surveillance Program&nbsp; </h3>

<p>Board policy also requires Tier 1 employees to participate in the Medical Surveillance
Program. This program monitors the health status of the employee to detect the presence of
work-related illness at an early stage to halt or reverse disease. It also evaluates the
fitness of field staff to ensure that only those medically sound participate in field
operations. </p>

<h3>3. Personal Protective &amp; Sampling Equipment </h3>

<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment.</strong> Field staff are required to use personal
protective equipment (PPE) when performing tasks which may create a hazard or potential
hazards. No single combination of protective equipment and clothing is capable of
protecting against all hazard. Thus, staff are reminded that PPE should be used in
conjunction with other protective methods. All IWMB staff are directed to follow proper
procedure and wear the required personal protection. Selection of PPE is based upon the
working tasks performed. The following items are made available to staff for ACW
inspection and sampling:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>disposable coveralls, tyvek </li>
  <li>air purifying respirators with HEPA cartridges </li>
  <li>disposable hand protection (optional) </li>
  <li>foot protection </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sampling Equipment</strong> </p>

<p><i>Sampling equipment would include sample containers, custody seals, etc..</i><br />
