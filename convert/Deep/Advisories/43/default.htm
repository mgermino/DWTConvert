    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this LEA Advisory is to identify the assistance the California
Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) can provide to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA)
before, during, and after a Federal, State, or locally declared state of emergency (or
disaster). </p>

	<h3>Board Disaster-Related Assistance&nbsp; </h3>

<p>Board staff can provide assistance before, during, and after declared states of
emergency (or disasters) in a variety of ways to enable the LEAs to more effectively
respond to disasters. </p>

	<h2>Disaster Preparedness&nbsp; </h2>

<p>Board staff has prepared the <i>Integrated Waste Management Disaster Plan - Guidance
for local government on disaster debris management</i>. The plan is designed to provide
guidance and assistance to the disaster preparedness planning efforts of local government.
Its primary purpose is to assist local jurisdictions in writing disaster debris management
plans for their communities and to encourage the establishment of diversion programs for
the debris generated after disasters. To this end, the plan provides an overview of the
debris management issues that an emergency manager will face after a disaster and
highlights those diversion programs that have been proven to be successful.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of primary importance to LEAs are the sections concerning temporary storage sites and
household hazardous waste. The first section discusses the need for temporary storage
sites and the criteria to use in selecting such sites. While the plan emphasizes the
advantages of securing temporary storage sites prior to a disaster, the emergency waiver
of standards can provide some additional options in establishing temporary storage sites.
If authorized by a LEA, an emergency waiver of standards can be granted to a solid waste
facility operator to establish a locally approved temporary transfer or processing site in
the event of a proclamation of a state of emergency. A separate advisory discussing the
issuance of emergency waivers of standards has been issued <a href="../41/default.htm">(LEA
Advisory No. 41)</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The purpose of the household hazardous waste (HHW) section is to provide assistance to
local jurisdictions in developing a disaster plan for the collection of HHW to minimize
potential public health and safety impacts as well as to minimize costs and
confusion.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Copies of the plan can be obtained by contacting the Board&#146;s Office of Local
Assistance at (916) 341-6253. </p>

<h2>Financial Assistance&nbsp; </h2>

<p>While the Board does not provide financial assistance to LEAs for disaster-related
expenses, reimbursement for disaster-related expenses is available, under certain
conditions, from both the Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. Reimbursement generally requires documentation of staff time and
materials expenditures. More information on record keeping requirements and other
conditions may be obtained from the State Office of Emergency Services at (916) 364-2044
for Northern California or (818) 440-2144 for Southern California or your local Office of
Emergency Services delegate. </p>

<h2>Technical Assistance&nbsp; </h2>

<p>The Board&#146;s Permitting and Enforcement (P&amp;E) Division staff can provide
assistance in assessing landfill damage and providing recommendations for the repair of
damage. Particular areas of Board expertise include, but are not limited to slope
stability and failure, seismic damage, severe erosion due to drainage and flooding
problems, gas system failures, landfill fires, alternative daily cover options, and
emergency construction contracts and oversight of construction.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Board staff can also assist LEAs in conducting joint site inspections of solid waste
facilities to determine disaster-related damage. These inspections are coordinated through
the Board&#146;s solid waste facility inspection coordinator. The inspection coordinator
has the primary responsibility for coordinating Board staff field inspections of solid
waste facilities within the area affected by the disaster. As part of this task the
coordinator establishes communications with LEAs and Board staff to secure local facility
damage estimates and requests LEA and other agency assistance in conducting emergency
inspections of solid waste facilities within their jurisdictions. The inspection
coordinator can be contacted at (916) 341-6406. </p>

<p>Permitting and Enforcement Division staff is also available to meet with LEA staff to
explore options for waivers of permit conditions and/or State minimum standards to assist
in the handling and disposal of the increased and diversified waste stream as the result
of the disaster. <a href="../41/default.htm">LEA Advisory No. 41</a> provides general and
step-by-step guidance on the emergency waiver of standards regulations and their
applicability to disaster-related waste handling and disposal concerns, issues, and
options. </p>

<h2><strong>Other Assistance&nbsp;</strong> </h2>

<p>Additional assistance Board staff can provide is the rescheduling of Board training
missed due to disaster-related activities of the LEA. Also, based on disaster-related
information, supplemental training may be developed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A non-exhaustive listing of available disaster-related Board assistance, including
contact persons and telephone numbers, is included as <a href="43attcha.htm">Attachment A</a>.
However, please note that this assistance is not limited to the time period of the
declared state of emergency but is also available before and after disaster-related
activities.&nbsp; </p>

	<h2>Board Information Needs </h2>

<p>As part of its particular role during emergency operations, the Board is required to
locate and assess the amount of damage to facilities under Board jurisdiction (i.e., solid
waste facilities) and report this information to the Office of Emergency Services as soon
as possible. In an effort to facilitate the collection of this information, LEAs are faxed
at the beginning of each disaster an <a href="43attchb.htm">&quot;LEA Disaster
Advisory&quot; (Attachment B).</a>&nbsp; </p>

<p>When assessing the condition of solid waste facilities after a disaster a number of
issues need to be considered including:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>Are there any landfill or other solid waste facility closures in your area? If so, which
    ones, why were they closed, and what are the consequences? </li>
  <li>Have any emergency waiver of standards been issued (14 CCR 17210 et seq.)? If so, which
    specific standards and conditions were waived and for which facilities? </li>
  <li>Are there any significant or unusual landfills or other solid waste facility problems in
    your area (gas, leachate, etc.) as a result of the disaster? If so, which landfill or
    solid waste facilities and what is the problem? </li>
  <li>Are there any waste handling backlogs and/or hazardous waste concerns? </li>
  <li>Are there other waste-related incidents?&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p>The consideration of the above questions/issues will greatly assist Board staff in
providing accurate disaster-related damage reports to the Office of Emergency Services and
in determining the necessity of emergency inspections.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Should you have any questions or comments concerning this advisory, please contact
Michael B. Wochnick at (916) 341-6318. </p>

<p>Sincerely,&nbsp; </p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide
guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties.
Guidance, for this purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board’s
regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a>

Advisories do not take precedence over statute or regulation.</p>
