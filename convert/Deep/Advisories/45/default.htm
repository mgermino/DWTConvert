    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this advisory is to provide guidance and information that will assist in
the selection of a method to determine the remaining capacity of a landfill. Also, the
methods discussed in this advisory can be useful in determining past and current landfill
volumes. </p>

<p>Public Resources Code, Division 30, Chapter 4, Article 1, Section 41701 was enacted
into law to ensure that each county has planned for adequate safe disposal capacity for a
minimum of 15 years. If a county determines that existing capacity will be exhausted
within 15 years, then an area or areas for the location of new solid waste disposal
facilities, or existing facilities that will be expanded, must be identified. </p>

<p>The determination of current and remaining capacities at solid waste landfills is a
critical aspect of site operations for owners/operators and local enforcement agencies
(LEA). Filling patterns, operational activities, and personnel and equipment planning can
be aided by calculation of the remaining capacity at a landfill. </p>

<p>State, regional, and local planners also need and utilize accurate information
concerning remaining capacity in planning for future development to ensure that adequate
landfill space is available. </p>

	<h3>Background </h3>

<p>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) authorized a survey to
determine California&#146;s remaining landfill capacity and the methods used to determine
those capacities. Approximately 250 landfills were surveyed during 1993 and 1994. Accurate
calculations of remaining landfill capacity are critical to State, regional, and local
planners in the development and placement of landfills in California. A report entitled <i>Determining
Remaining Permitted Capacity of California&#146;s Sanitary Landfills</i> was the result of
that survey and was accepted by the CIWMB at its May 1995 meeting. It is suggested that
this report be reviewed in conjunction with this advisory. It can be obtained from the
following sources: 

<ul>
  <li>Call the CIWMB&#146;s hotline (1-800-CA-WASTE) for a hard copy. </li>
  <li>Download from the CIWMB&#146;s <a href="/Publications/">Publications
    Catalog</a>. The report is listed under Solid Waste Facilities and
    Operations. </li>
</ul>

	<h3>Considerations For Determining Remaining Landfill Capacity </h3>

<p>The following sections provide information to assist in understanding the concepts and
terminology of landfill capacity and topographical maps. </p>

<p><img SRC="finalcap.gif" WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="192" ALIGN="Right"><strong><i>What Is
Remaining Landfill Capacity?</i></strong> </p>

<p>Determination of the remaining capacity of a landfill using topographical methods
involves knowing the current and final configuration of the currently permitted landfill.
The current and final configuration of the landfill is used to determine the current and
final volumes. The remaining capacity is calculated by subtracting the current volume used
from the final volume (<i>final capacity - existing capacity = remaining capacity).</i> </p>

<p><img SRC="rtocrate.gif" WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="207" ALIGN="Right"><strong><i>What Is
a Refuse-to-Cover Ratio?</i></strong> </p>

<p>A refuse-to-cover ratio is the volume of daily or intermediate cover material that is
placed over a volume of refuse. For example, if 100 cubic yards (CY) of refuse were
disposed and 25 CY of cover material were used to cover the refuse; the refuse-to-cover
ratio would be 4:1. This ratio must be determined on a site-specific basis as it is
operation dependent. </p>

<p>Numerous landfills throughout California use alternative daily cover (ADC) due to the
lack of available cover materials for diversion or in an effort to save space for
landfilling. The proper use of an ADC may significantly reduce the need for daily cover
and subsequently change the refuse-to-cover ratio. </p>

<p><strong><i>What Is Settlement?</i></strong> </p>

<p>Settlement in landfills is usually the result of consolidation of in-place refuse.
Consolidation occurs when initial void (air) spaces in the refuse are replaced with
surrounding waste and can be the result of additional refuse placement and/or the
decomposition of the existing waste. Settlement is usually a process that occurs over time
and is difficult to notice on a day-by-day basis. </p>

<p>In a few instances, settlement can occur as a result of an earthquake or consolidation
of materials (soft soil base) located below the landfill. </p>

<p>Settlement rates vary with the type of refuse placed, operational techniques
(compaction effort and equipment), as well as climatic conditions (dry vs. moist). The
settlement rate of a landfill varies with time. </p>

<p>Typically, primary settlement occurs within the first few years (one to three) of
refuse placement and long term settlement occurs over an extended period of time
(four-plus years). There is no definitive study indicating the length of time or the
maximum amount of settlement that is expected to occur; however, one study indicated that
as much as 30 percent (of landfill height) settlement may occur after waste disposal
ceases. </p>

<p><img SRC="settle.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="213" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="12"> </p>

<p>The gradual action of landfill settlement can have the effect of increasing landfill
space over time. As an example, 1200 pounds of refuse may occupy 1.0 CY in a landfill when
placed. Consolidation of that 1200 pounds of refuse may decrease the space occupied by 25
percent to 0.75 CY. That could mean an additional 25 percent of space for refuse
placement. It is estimated that settlement at a landfill varies from 10 to 40 percent (of
landfill height). Final settlement percentages are site specific and depend on the type of
waste placed and the construction technique used. </p>

<p>Settlement can be minimized by greater compaction effort (increasing compaction
equipment weight or additional passes with existing equipment) during the placement of
waste. The additional action forces more waste into a smaller area. The decision to use
heavier equipment or more passes with existing equipment is not only a settlement issue;
it is also an economic one. The settlement process can also be increased by surcharging.
Surcharging is the placing of additional weight (e.g. stockpiled soil) on top of a
specific area to induce consolidation or settlement. </p>

<p><img SRC="density.gif" WIDTH="245" HEIGHT="177" ALIGN="right">The graph to
the right displays the relationship between the number of passes that compaction equipment
makes and the increasing density. Note that after about five passes with the compaction
equipment, the increased density per pass decreases. This graph is typical only and
individual equipment will provide individual results. (Reprinted from the <i>Caterpillar
Performance Handbook, 22nd Edition</i>, October 1991.) </p>

<p><strong><i>What Is the Importance of Map Scale and Accuracy?</i></strong> </p>

<p>Scaling of the map is an important decision relating directly to both reading and using
the information on the map. The scale of the map should reflect consideration of the
purpose, size, accuracy, and required precision of the finished topographical map. </p>

<p>In general, topographical maps are developed using one of the following scales: 

<ul>
  <li>1&quot; = 200' with a two-foot contour, and one-foot accuracy. </li>
  <li>1&quot; = 100' with a two-foot contour; and one-foot accuracy. </li>
  <li>1&quot; = 40' with a one-foot contour, and one-half-foot accuracy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Accuracy of a topographical map is usually one-half of the contour interval; therefore,
if the contour interval is two feet then the accuracy of points on the map are within one
foot. The accuracy of a topographical map applies to specific elevations marked on the map
such as targets, building corners or cross-hair locations (+). </p>

<p>The method chosen to calculate the remaining landfill capacity may help determine the
appropriate map scale. Computer-generated programs that determine capacity do not require
scaling because the topographic information is taken directly from the original data file.
However, the use of a manual method for determining remaining landfill capacity will
require a topographical map that is clear and readable. For example, a 150-acre landfill
that is approximately equal in width and length should fit well on a D (24&quot; X
36&quot;) size drawing at a scale of 1&quot; = 200' with a two-foot contour and one-foot
accuracy. </p>

<p><strong><i>What Are Control Points?</i></strong> </p>

<p>Control points are locations where the elevation as well as location (northing and
easting) are known to an exact specification. These locations and the accuracy they
provide enable a ground or aerial survey to be accurately completed. The terms northing
and easting are used to locate a specific point on a plane from a predetermined location.
The predetermined locations have been chosen by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS).
For example, a survey marker may be located by describing its location as 1,101,357 feet
north and 357,687 feet east of a known location. West and south can also be used. </p>

<p>Horizontal control is provided by two or more points, precisely fixed in position
horizontally by distance and direction. Vertical control is provided by benchmarks in or
near the tract to be surveyed. These controls become the foundation for correctly
portraying relief on a map. The actual number of control points should be determined by
consultation with survey professionals. </p>

<p><strong><i>What Are Contour Lines?</i></strong> </p>

<p>A contour line is a line connecting points of equal elevation. The contour interval
selected depends on a map&#146;s purpose, scale, and diversity of relief in the area. The
smaller the difference between contour lines, the more costly the final product, partly
due to increased field work. </p>

<p><strong><i>What Are Benchmarks?</i></strong> </p>

<p>Benchmarks are usually small metal plates marked with information and placed in
concrete, usually on the ground. Benchmarks can either be permanent, for repeated use, or
temporary, for one project use and then destroyed. Whenever possible, benchmarks are
placed in accessible locations for reuse and kept safe from damage. All surveying must be
completed and adjusted to known permanent benchmarks, including designating an elevation
and location (northing and easting). These benchmarks are usually located throughout most
counties for easy reference. An experienced surveyor should either have access to the
benchmark locations or know how to obtain the information. </p>

	<h3>Methods for Determining Remaining Landfill Capacity </h3>

<p>Based on the survey, the three most commonly used methods in the State of California
for the determination of remaining capacity are: 

<ul>
  <li>Topographical Survey Methods </li>
  <li>Weight-Based Methods </li>
  <li>Trench-Based Methods </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for the purposes of this advisory, current in-place volume and total and
remaining capacity will be discussed in terms of cubic yards (CY), because the volume
capacity of a landfill (in CYs) is a constant. Because the in-place density of a waste is
highly variable, a discussion of landfill capacity in terms of tonnage would be
misleading. Reports from landfills in California have reported in-place densities ranging
from approximately 1000 to 1600 lbs/CY. </p>

<p><strong><i>Topographical Survey Methods</i></strong> </p>

<p>Topographical mapping is the process of graphically representing natural and man-made
features for a given locality and for the determination of the configuration of the
terrain on a map. Topographical maps are the most widely used form of representation of
landfills in California. </p>

<p>By means of various lines and conventional symbols, topographic maps are produced from
survey data. Names, legends, and various lines are used to identify features such as
roads, trees, streams, lakes, trails, buildings, and boundary lines on the map. </p>

<p>Topographical surveys have been shown to be a valuable tool for accurately determining
volumetric quantities for landfills. Depending on the need and the information available,
the volumetric quantities can be for the past, current, or the final volume for a
landfill. </p>

<p>Topographical maps can be developed using ground or aerial surveys. The decision as to
which survey would be appropriate is based on site-specific considerations such as
landfill size, availability of a survey crew, and total costs. </p>

<p>The use of topographical methods combined with weight-based disposal data provide an
added benefit of determining the density (weight/volume) ratio for disposed waste. </p>

<p>The use of daily and intermediate cover requires airspace in the landfill. Therefore,
the ratio of refuse to cover material must be determined so an accurate estimate of
remaining airspace may be calculated. </p>

<p>The following two sections will discuss the ground survey and photogrammetric methods
of preparing a topographical map. </p>

<p><strong>What Is a Ground Survey?</strong> </p>

<p>A ground survey is conducted using a ground crew to develop a topographic map
representing the existing terrain. Ground surveys are usable in essentially all situations
where topographic or boundary data is needed for landfill operations. Considerations for
using the ground survey method should include, but not be limited to, the size of
landfill, availability of personnel, and total costs. </p>

<p>Ground surveys are most likely to be cost-effective for smaller landfills, usually
about 10 acres or less. The use of ground surveys for smaller landfills is usually less
expensive than aerial surveys due to the cost of setting up control points (targets) and
initial startup fees (airplane and initial calculations) required for use with aerial
surveys. </p>

<p>The availability of a survey crew to perform the work during a given time period may be
an issue for some landfills. Heavy construction periods or development may limit the
availability of a survey crew to perform the work. </p>

<p>Total cost for a ground survey should be considered. The component costs at a minimum
may include a site visit, pre-field office preparation, actual field work, and map
preparation and duplication. </p>

<p>In some cases only localized topographical surveys may be required at a larger
landfill. For instance, if only a small area has changed due to localized filling it may
not be necessary to obtain a topographical map of the entire site; therefore, a ground
survey may be appropriate. </p>

<p>How to Choose a Land Surveyor </p>

<p><i>Licensing and Sign-off.</i> Professional land surveyors in California are licensed
and regulated by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land
Surveyors (BORPELS) as specified in the Professional Land Surveyors Act. Confirmation of
the status of a surveyor&#146;s California license and any disciplinary actions can be
obtained by contacting BORPELS in Sacramento, California, at (916) 263-2222 or (916)
263-2233. </p>

<p>Only a licensed land surveyor or an eligible civil engineer may set or determine
property boundary lines within the State of California. Therefore, any surveying that is
submitted or completed that requires the determination of property boundary lines will
require one of the above individuals to perform or directly supervise and sign off on the
submitted survey. Certain maps are required by regulations to be signed by a Registered
Civil Engineer or Certified Engineering Geologist, such as maps depicting the final grade
or drainage designs of landfills. </p>

<p>Please note that not all documents prepared require the seal and signature of a
registered land surveyor or civil engineer. Some information may be obtained and used for
in-house or submittal purposes by knowledgeable individuals. Examples of map submittals
that would not require a signature and seal include vicinity maps and/or site maps. </p>

<p><i>Experience/References.</i> Experience with the required tasks should be considered
when selecting a surveyor. Time and types of surveying completed by the selected
contractor are also important considerations. A land surveyor that is relatively new to
topographical work on a large scale and who has only completed work on small subdivisions
in the past may require additional time and assistance to prepare a landfill topographical
map. </p>

<p>Due to the importance of accurate information for purposes of planning and landfill
site operations, experience with the work to be performed will save time and money and
produce a better product. Actual work on landfills may not be necessary; however,
experience with the production of topographical maps is suggested. It is always a good
practice to check the references of any contractor who will be used for the first time. A
review of previous topographical maps prepared by the surveyor would provide information
on the quality of the work produced. </p>

<p><i>Insurance.</i> Proof of insurance of a contractor should also be considered when
preparing a contract for services. Engineers and land surveyors normally carry errors and
omissions insurance as well as liability insurance and a performance bond. </p>

<p><strong>What Is an Aerial (Photogrammetric) Survey?</strong> </p>

<p>Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements and preparing maps from aerial
photographs. The process of aerial photogrammetry includes the operations, processes, and
products involving the use of aerial photographs. Included among these are the measurement
of horizontal distances, the determination of elevations, the compilation of planimetric
and topographic maps, the measurement of profiles and cross-sections, and the
interpretation and analysis of aerial photographs for engineering investigations. </p>

<p>How Is It Done? </p>

<p>Aerial photogrammetry uses stereo pairs of photographs to interpret the selected area.
The use of an aircraft to take the pictures requires good visibility and favorable wind
conditions for a successful flight. Cloud cover, rain, or windy conditions can prohibit
the flight for aerial photogrammetry. </p>

<p>Office preparation and coordination of information between the ground and aerial survey
companies are essential parts of developing a flight plan for the survey. </p>

<p>The aerial photographs are analyzed using previously placed ground control points.
These control points enable the determination of elevations (contour lines) and horizontal
distances within the designated area. The control points are set by qualified land
surveyors at exact elevations and locations. The number and size of control points
necessary is determined by the aerial surveyor after consideration of the size and
configuration of the landfill. Most control points are placed slightly outside the
perimeter of the landfill and, if necessary, on the landfill itself to confirm elevations
and locations. The target information is then given to the individual interpreting the
aerial photograph and is used in developing the topographical map. </p>

<p>Optimum Conditions </p>

<p>The taking of an aerial photograph used to develop a topographical map requires
favorable weather conditions. The sun must be greater than a 30-degree angle from the
horizon and the sky must be clear of clouds and the land of fog. Because of the reduced
shadows, noon is the optimum time for an aerial photograph for developing a topographical
map. </p>

<p>Costs </p>

<p>Due to the high cost of pre flight preparation, the airplane, the flight crew, and the
photo interpretation, the flight for the aerial survey may be more expensive than using a
ground survey crew for the site. </p>

<p>Timeline </p>

<p>Once the aerial photograph has been taken, the time necessary to prepare the
topographical map can vary from as little as two weeks to as long as three months,
depending on the amount of detail required and the aerial firm&#146;s workload. </p>

<p>How to Choose an Aerial Surveyor </p>

<p><i>Licensing and Sign-off. </i>At this time the State of California does not have a
licensing requirement for aerial surveying; however, licensed land surveyors or engineers
can be aerial surveyors. To ensure that the map produced is accurate, a land surveyor can
work in conjunction with the aerial surveyor and sign off on the accuracy of the produced
map. It would be beneficial for someone using an aerial firm to ask about standards and
quality control of the process used. Experience in flight preparation, project planning,
and aerial photography interpretations are critical in preparation of an accurate
topographical map. </p>

<p><i>Aerial/Ground Survey Cooperation.</i> An important issue when choosing an aerial
surveying firm is the consideration of the ground survey and the aerial survey firm
cooperation. For a topographical survey to be valid and usable, information from the
ground survey must be given to the aerial firm for use in interpretation of the
photographs used to produce the topographical maps. The aerial survey firm must work with
the ground survey firm in determining the number, size, and placement of the ground
control points (targets). </p>

<p><i>Planning/Climate Considerations.</i> Planning for an aerial survey needs to include
the availability of the crew and airplane. The number of firms performing aerial surveys
within the state are limited and their flight time is restricted by climatic conditions.
It is not unusual for an aerial firm to propose a flight date for the photograph and have
to postpone due to cloud cover reducing the visibility or excessive winds prohibiting the
straight line flight required to take the photographs. </p>

<p><i>Experience/References/Insurance. </i>Experience with the required tasks should be
considered when selecting an aerial surveyor. Time and types of surveying completed by the
selected contractor are important considerations. Due to the importance of accurate
information for purposes of planning and landfill site operations, experience with the
work to be performed will save time and money and produce a better product. Actual work on
landfills may not be necessary; however, experience with the production of topographical
maps is suggested. </p>

<p>It is always a good practice to check references on any aerial surveying contractor
that will be used for the first time. A review of previous topographical maps prepared by
the surveyor would provide information on the quality of the work produced. </p>

<p>Proof of insurance of a contractor should also be considered when preparing a contract
for services. </p>

<p><strong>Comparison of Topographical Methods</strong> </p>

<p>In some cases the choice between the use of aerial or ground survey will be difficult.
A comparison of aerial and ground survey methods is displayed on the attached table 
<a HREF="../45/adv45attch.htm#A">(Attachment A).</a> </p>

<p>The following information should be considered when choosing between the ground survey
and aerial methods of preparing a topographical map. </p>

<p><strong>Ground surveys</strong> with manual data development and calculations are likely to be
advantageous under the following parameters: 

<ul>
  <li>A competent workforce is available at internal rates, such as company or county
    surveying crews. </li>
  <li>Area to be surveyed is less than 10 acres, or data collection needs are relatively
    small. </li>
  <li>Site topography is not so variable as to overly restrict foot-access to survey points. </li>
  <li>Survey, mapping, measuring, and/or computing equipment is available economically. </li>
  <li>Aerial survey vendors are not readily available. </li>
  <li>The combined time window for ground visibility and seasonal weather changes are too
    narrow to schedule aerial photography reliably. </li>
  <li>Cover soil management or other site operations considerations require closer (more
    frequent) fill rate monitoring than is practical with aerial photography. </li>
  <li>Waste flow quantities are small resulting in only minor topographic changes. </li>
  <li>Data are needed before the aerial photography process can be completed. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aerial surveys</strong> are likely to be advantageous if the following parameters apply: 

<ul>
  <li>Internal field workforces are not readily available. </li>
  <li>Site size and/or data collection needs are substantial. </li>
  <li>Site topography allows placement of ground control target points, but otherwise makes
    ground survey of the site impractical. </li>
  <li>Aerial survey vendors are available and affordable. </li>
  <li>The seasonal time window, if applicable, is adequate for aerial photography. </li>
  <li>Adequate lead-time is available for completing the automated process. </li>
  <li>Automated photography, mapping, and/or computing equipment is available economically. </li>
  <li>Skilled mapping, data extraction, and computational staff or contractors are available
    and affordable. </li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid confusion, additional costs, and delays, a draft copy of the topographical map
should be reviewed by knowledgeable landfill personnel prior to producing the final map to
assure that all appropriate information is included and that it is accurate. </p>

<p><strong>Calculating Capacities Using Topographical Maps</strong> </p>

<p>Once a topographical map has been prepared using either the ground survey or aerial
survey method, the calculation of remaining capacities can be completed by using either
automated or manual techniques. The method chosen depends on the resources available and
the desired outcome. Consistency in using a calculation from one time to the next is
important to insure information is as accurate as possible. </p>

<p>Electronic Calculation </p>

<p>For a computer to be able to calculate landfill capacity, the information must be in a
computer file that is compatible with the program used to perform the necessary
calculations. Computer-aided design (CAD) programs can use appropriate ASCII files to
determine remaining landfill capacity. The computer hardware needs for these calculations
depend on the program's requirement. For instance, certain versions of CAD programs
require minimum RAM for operation. </p>

<p>Manual Calculation </p>

<p>The &quot;average end method&quot; of determining volumes can be used manually to
determine remaining capacity from computer-created maps as well as manually drawn
topographical maps. This method can be used with either vertical or horizontal cross
sections of the landfill. A cross section area (square feet) is determined and then
averaged with an adjacent cross section area. The average area is then multiplied by the
distance between the two cross sections producing a volume in cubic feet. The distance
between cross sections can be from 10 to 100 feet depending on the number of cross
sections that must be completed. The volume of the area between the two cross-sections is
then divided by 27 to convert the cubic feet number to a cubic yard (27 cubic feet = 1
cubic yard). <a HREF="../45/adv45attch.htm#B">Attachment B</a> provides an example of the
average-end method. The volumes between all the cross sections will be added together to
give a total volume of the area represented by the topographical map. The manual method is
labor intensive and requires both experience and the ability to perform repetitive
calculations accurately. Experience of the technician using the manual method is very
important. </p>

<p><strong>How Often Should Topographical Maps Be Prepared for Volume Calculations?</strong> </p>

<p>Site-specific conditions should be considered when determining the frequency of
topographical map production. The map can be used for determination of remaining capacity;
however, it can also be used as a valuable tool to ensure that compaction efforts are
producing the density/volume ratios expected and in preparing future filling plans. It may
be necessary to produce a topographical map on an annual basis: 

<ul>
  <li>For sites that are nearing completion. </li>
  <li>For sites that require available space data for planning. </li>
  <li>As a tool to assure that compaction techniques are obtaining the desired results. </li>
</ul>

<p>A rural landfill that receives minimal waste volumes may require a new topographical
map every five years. A larger, more active landfill may need a topographical map prepared
annually or partial updates more frequently. This map can then be used to update the
information in the report of disposal site information and the solid waste facility
permit. </p>

<p>One advantage of using periodic topographic surveys to assess remaining capacity is
that the method provides a cross-check for determining in-place density of refuse. </p>

<p><strong><i>Weight-Based Methods</i></strong> </p>

<p>Weight-based estimates for determining landfill capacity convert weight data to volume
using an assumption about the in-fill density of waste materials. The converted volume of
material is subtracted from the total available airspace (capacity). This method requires
no special expertise beyond careful record keeping and conducting basic mathematical
calculations, using a scale for weighing the amount of waste received, and a scientific
calculator or computer spreadsheet program. </p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong> </p>

<p>This method is generally not as accurate due to inherent problems: 

<ul>
  <li>There are a relatively large number of assumptions, such as density, refuse-to-cover
    ratio, and settlement used in the calculations, and an error in assumption can compound
    into significant inaccuracies. </li>
  <li>There are no built-in cross-checks in the method. </li>
  <li>The amount of daily and intermediate cover used must be carefully taken into account. </li>
  <li>Many small landfills lack scales. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Applicability</strong> </p>

<p>This method relies entirely on assumptions about density and refuse-to-cover ratios,
with infrequent or no cross-checks using topographic surveys. Although this method is less
accurate, because of the relative ease and low cost, it is recommended for smaller-area
landfills receiving less than 10 tons per day or slightly larger tonnage at landfills with
a large amount of remaining capacity. It is suggested that an occasional topographical
survey be performed to provide a more accurate update of the benchmark capacity. </p>

<p><strong>Variation</strong> </p>

<p>A variation on the weight-to-volume conversion method is the in-truck volume to
landfilled volume conversion method. This method, which can be used by landfill operators
who do not have a truck scale, involves measuring the volume of materials in trucks
arriving at the facility, making assumptions about the density of these materials, and
calculating the weight of the materials. As an example, the density of waste that has been
collected in an open truck will be significantly less than the waste that was picked up by
a collection truck with a hydraulic compaction system. It should be noted that packer
collection trucks (trucks that pack refuse in their storage area) vary in the density that
they may obtain, due the effort by trucks hydraulic system. The greater the waste density
upon receipt, the less compaction effort will have to be used for placement in the
landfill. </p>

<p>The landfill operator then calculates or estimates the density of landfilled material
and refuse-to-cover ratios to derive an estimate of the amount of landfill space used.
This method requires tracking incoming loads by truck type, size, and fullness, then using
density assumptions and a simple spreadsheet to convert volume to weight. Like the
weight-to-volume method, this method also involves estimating or calculating
refuse-to-cover ratios and taking into consideration design features and other
contingencies. </p>

<p>Calculating remaining capacity using the weight-based method may take from several
hours to several days depending on the following factors: 

<ul>
  <li>The size of the landfill. </li>
  <li>The time since the last topographical survey was done. </li>
  <li>The completeness of records of in-coming material. </li>
  <li>Daily and intermediate cover usage. </li>
  <li>Basic operating parameters (such as weight of equipment, average number of passes, depth
    of spread material, slope of working face). </li>
</ul>

<p>If an assessment of remaining capacity has not been performed for a number of years,
then operators can assume that they will spend considerable time and effort the first time
this method is employed. Subsequent annual updates should be relatively simple and quick,
particularly if operating parameters and the character of the waste stream do not change
significantly and if records are complete and accurate. </p>

<p><strong><i>Trench-Based Methods</i></strong> </p>

<p>Determination of remaining landfill capacity using trench-based calculations requires
minimal information that can easily be gathered in the field or from previous construction
notes and future design specifications. Landfills that use a trench disposal method can
easily determine remaining capacity with simple field observations and basic mathematical
calculations, as long as the dimensions of the trenches can be accurately determined. </p>

<p>The accuracy of those remaining capacity calculations will depend on the reliability of
the information used. Determining remaining capacity of a trench-type fill involves
measuring the length, width, and depth of each existing and planned trench to assess the
volume of each. Site life, density of landfilled material, and refuse-to-cover ratio can
all be calculated by measuring the length of trench used, the weight of incoming material,
and the volume of cover material used. This method allows for cross-checking of remaining
capacity by monitoring the rate of fill over time. </p>

<p>For instance, an operator of a landfill with a constant waste stream calculates that it
takes approximately one year to fill a trench with known dimensions. If the operator has
enough space left for 15 similar trenches and the waste stream is not expected to change,
then it can be estimated that the site has approximately 15 years of capacity remaining. </p>

	<h3>Selection of Method to Be Used </h3>

<p>The selection of a method to be used to determine the remaining capacity of a landfill
is a site-specific decision. Site-specific information should include information on site
history, economics, local and State planning, as well as a combination of present and
future needs, available resources, and type of operation and equipment available. </p>

<p>Table 1, &quot;Comparison of Recommended Methods for Determining Remaining
Capacity,&quot; from the report <a HREF="../45/adv45attch.htm#A"><i>Determining Remaining Permitted
Capacity of California&#146;s Sanitary Landfills,</i> is attached (Attachment A)</a> and
provides an overview of the costs, accuracy, landfill type, size of landfill, and
equipment/experience required for use of the various methods listed in this advisory. </p>

<p><strong><i>Trench-Based Method</i></strong> </p>

<p><strong>Appropriate Use</strong> </p>

<p>A trench-based landfill (typically small) that has historically used the trench-based
method to determine remaining capacity may wish to continue with that method, providing
past calculations have been shown to be accurate. If a single trench was estimated to take
six months to fill and actually took six months to fill, then the trench-based method may
be adequate for that site&#146;s needs. Additionally, for those trench-based disposal
sites that want more accurate information or where past calculations have shown
inaccuracies, additional steps to determine density may improve the remaining capacity
data. Those additional steps could include determining the weight of the refuse by use of
a scale or estimating the weight by volume of the refuse prior to placement. The
trench-based method is the least expensive of the three discussed in this advisory for
determining remaining landfill capacity. </p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong> </p>

<p>Costs for determining the remaining capacity of a trench-based landfill are relatively
minor in comparison to both weight-based and topographical methods. Measurement of the
trench and accurate notes as to the time necessary to fill the trench are the minimum
requirements needed. With a few simple calculations, the remaining capacity can be
estimated. It is reasonable to assume that this method could be completed within one day
of staff time. </p>

<p><strong><i>Weight-Based Method</i></strong> </p>

<p><strong>Appropriate Use</strong> </p>

<p>Weight-based landfill calculations provide a remaining capacity calculation that is
dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions used. Without extensive record keeping or
repetitive calculations to determine density and refuse-to-cover ratios, the remaining
capacity may not be as accurate as expected or necessary and appropriate. In addition, the
use of topographical maps for determining the remaining volume coupled with the density
information will increase the accuracy of this method. However, the addition of a
topographical map to the weight-based method will significantly increase the cost. The
topographical map that would need to be completed for this type of evaluation would not be
as extensive as one that would need to be prepared for the topographic map method. </p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong> </p>

<p>The cost for determining the remaining landfill capacity using the weight-based method
is directly related to the method used for collecting the weight information and
calculating the capacity. The collection of accurate data is vital to this method for
determining the remaining capacity. If the weight data is collected by a scale and
computer system, the amount of staff time will be minimized. If the weight data is
collected and recorded by hand then staff time will increase. The calculation time and
costs will also be determined by whether a computer spreadsheet or program is used versus
staff performing the calculations by hand. </p>

<p><strong><i>Topographical Survey Method</i></strong> </p>

<p><strong>Appropriate Use</strong> </p>

<p>Topographical maps are considered the most accurate method for determining remaining
capacity. A topographical map can be produced using either the ground survey or aerial
methods. The selection of the type of method to use is again a site-specific consideration
taking into account resources, need, timing and costs. </p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong> </p>

<p>Surveying costs usually include time for preparation, the field survey, and preparation
of the map. All three functions are equally important with regard to accuracy and cost.
Costs should be estimated for these three functions. </p>

<p>To enable a surveyor to prepare and give an accurate cost estimate, the following
information should be provided when requesting services: 

<ul>
  <li>Area to be covered (outlined map). </li>
  <li>The topographical map scale (1&quot;=100', 1&quot;=40', etc.) needed. </li>
  <li>Accuracy and contour interval. </li>
  <li>Due date. </li>
  <li>Type of product needed (reproducible mylars, blue lines, additional contact prints,
    photographs from aerial, etc.). </li>
</ul>

<p>For long-term cost savings it may be appropriate to have a permanent benchmark
(permanent mark with exact location known) placed on stable native ground near the
landfill. The placement of a known location would increase costs initially; however, it
could save resources and money in the long run. It is important that if a benchmark is
placed it be well documented and protected from being disturbed or damaged. </p>

<p>To keep costs of conducting occasional surveys to a minimum, landfill operators may be
able to use existing equipment and expertise (e.g., having county road surveying crews
conduct a ground survey), and use in-house expertise to perform volume calculations. The
cost of conducting aerial surveys can be minimized if the photogrammetry of the landfill
is conducted as an add-on to another aerial survey in the area; or, if off-the-shelf,
commercial aerials are available. If no topographic survey has ever been performed on the
fill, there will be the additional expense of digitizing the final contours or conducting
manual area and volume calculations of the remaining planned lifts. These steps need not
be repeated each time the topographic survey is conducted unless design parameters change
in the interim. </p>
