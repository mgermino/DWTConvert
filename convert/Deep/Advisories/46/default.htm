    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong></p>

<p><i><strong>Site-Specific Health and Safety Report</strong></i> </p>

	<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Board recognizes that there are times when an employee, in performing field duties,
may inadvertently be exposed to potentially hazardous environments associated with tire
burning. It is Board policy to provide a safe and healthful working environment for all of
its employees. LEAs and staff working within the Permitting and Enforcement Division may
provide technical assistance in response to a tire fire. The intent of this document is to
provide guidance to prevent and or protect them from unsafe conditions. To predict the
exact conditions, emissions, and potential exposure to open burning of tires is extremely
difficult due to variability of site conditions. This document is a compilation of
available information through literature review, known tire fire data, and other available
information. </p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It has been estimated that over 29.5 million tires are generated each year in
California, of which 21 million are considered waste tires. Only about one-half of one
percent by weight of the total municipal solid waste stream consists of tires. However,
their shape, size, and physical and chemical properties present an unusually challenging
disposal problem. </p>

<p>In the past few years, many landfills have refused to accept tires because they present
not only a disposal problem (statute prohibited the disposal of whole tires after 1993 in
permitted solid waste disposal sites) but health-related problems. Facilities disposing of
tires have increased their fees, resulting in the creation of tire stockpiles and illegal
dumps. When improperly managed, these stockpiles present a significant risk to the
environment and public health. The risks arise from the potential for fires and the
potential to become a breeding ground for insects, especially mosquitoes. </p>

<p>Tires are highly combustible. Even when densely piled, there can be enough oxygen
supply for combustion. Tire fires are most often started by arson, and generate a large
amount of heat, which makes them extremely difficult to extinguish. Some tire fires have
continued to burn for months. An example is the Rhinehart tire fire in Winchester,
Virginia, which burned for nearly nine months. This uncontrolled burning of tire piles
produces smoke and toxic air pollutants, including benzene and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAH). The intense heat leads to the generation of pyrolytic oil that mixes
with extinguishing material, contaminating surrounding soils, surface waters, and
groundwater.<sup>i</sup> </p>

	<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Tires are a mixture of vulcanized or cross-linked polymers, carbon black, dispersing
oil, sulfur, synthetic fibers, pigments, processing chemicals, and steel or fiberglass.
Tire manufacturers use a variety of formulation recipes when producing tires. For specific
information on the processing and manufacturing of tires refer to the Board&#146;s report <i>Effects
of Waste Tires, Waste Tire Facilities, and Waste Tire Projects on the Environment</i>. The
following table lists a typical tire composition. </p>

<hr>

<p>An automobile tire weighs about 20 pounds, with a diameter ranging from 18-30 inches.
In addition to rubber, a tire contains some steel in the bead and some rayon or steel in
the belt. An average tire is produced from about 2.5 gallons of petroleum, making it a
good source of heat energy. Shredded or chipped tires, without their steel belts, have an
energy content ranging from 14,000 to 15,000 Btu per pound. Coal has an energy content of
8,000 to 12,000 Btu per pound. </p>

	<h2>Process</h2>
<p>When tires are burned, the rank smell can probably be attributed to sulfur-bearing
compounds. The carbon black used in the vulcanization of rubber is the source of most of
the dark particulate matter. &quot;As a tire burns, two distinct types of burning appear
to occur, during which emissions will differ. These burn patterns correspond to the
materials in the tread layers and the belt layers of the tires.&quot; (CTC,1989, page 3)
Tire combustion occurs at a temperature range of approximately 100 (remote from the flame)
to 2000 (at the flame front) degrees centigrade (<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> C). Ideal
burn conditions would include adequate time for mixing of fuel and air, high temperatures,
and complete mixing between the fuel and air. The fire burn rate can be affected by the
material size. Shredded tires will burn at a much lower rate than chunk tires. Small-scale
simulation of open burning of tires found the gaps between the tire material provides a
pathway for oxygen transport and appears to be the controlling mechanism for sustaining
the combustion process. </p>

<p>Thermal degradation and oxidation of tires is a function of the process conditions
applied, cross-linkage, and how the rubber is cured. Degradation below 250<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> C produces an oily tar. Gaseous C1-C5 hydrocarbons (methane,
ethane, isopropene, butadiene, propane) are produced at temperatures typically between 250<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> -450<font FACE="Symbol">�</font> C. As the reaction proceeds,
various primary products formed in the initial fragmentation will be rapidly converted
into secondary products. Several aromatic and cyclic compounds by means of the Diels-Alder
reaction are also produced. </p>

<p>It has been shown that open burning, regardless of feed stock or fuel, results in
greater mutagenic emission factors than does controlled combustion provided by
incinerators, boilers, cement kilns, or other combustion devices. Chunk tires produce
higher burn rates and more potent organic emissions than do shredded tires. The mutagenic
emission factor for the open burning of tires was 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than
that for the combustion of oil, coal, or wood in a utility boiler. </p>

	<h2>Airborne Emissions</h2>
<p>All tire fires may vary and the <i>exact emissions and concentrations</i> cannot be
predicted. There are many factors that influence the emissions produced while the fire is
burning. Some of these factors include the amount of fuel, fire temperature, meterologic
conditions, topography of the area, etc. In most cases airborne emissions found will
include volatile organics, semivolatile organics (including polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons [PAH]), carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, which includes metals. </p>

<p>In 1983, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) evaluated a
fire containing approximately 5 million tires. This fire, called the Rhinehart Tire Fire,
covered a 4-acre site and created a black plume of smoke approximately 3,000 feet high and
30-50 miles long. The NIOSH evaluation showed no acute hazard for employees performing
containment and cleanup operations. Airborne monitoring of the plume indicated the
presence of carbon monoxide (50-100 ppm), PAH (58-6802 ng/m<sup>3</sup>), metals (all
below 2 ug/m<sup>3 </sup>except lead, zinc, and iron), total organic compounds (0.73-0.81
mg/m<sup>3 </sup>), and nitrosamine (below laboratory detection limits). (See report for
more specific emission data information.) The potential for excessive inhalation exposure
to PAHs and carbon monoxide and dermal absorption of heavy metals, primarily zinc and
lead, were reported as exposure concerns. </p>

<p>Volatile organic emissions were detected during the 16-acre Panoche Tire Fire, which
burned 3-5 million tires within a steep-sided box canyon. Benzene concentrations did not
exceed OSHA and NIOSH allowable exposure levels when sampled on two different days at a
location 50 feet downwind of the fire. Measured benzene levels ranged from .43-.50 mg/m<sup>3</sup>.
Airborne emission sampling also detected, not significantly, PAHs, metals, and
semivolatile organics (see report for more specific emission data information). These
concentrations did not exceed regulatory allowable exposure levels. Sampling points were
50 feet downwind, 50 feet upwind and west and east of the visual smoke plume. Subsequent
industrial hygiene monitoring of Board personnel many weeks after the fire had been
extinguished indicated no employee overexposure. Sampling results indicated no detectable
hydrocarbons or heavy metals dust (zinc, cadmium, chromium, and lead). The breathing zone
samples were taken during site supervision and the soil sampling process. Air monitoring
results of employees performing remediation activities, specifically scraping burn
residues from the canyon walls onto the floor, showed the presence of nuisance particulate
(.51-11 mg/m<sup>3</sup> ), zinc (&lt;0.002-11 mg/m<sup>3 </sup>), and PAHs below their
detection limits (See report for more specific emission data information). </p>

<p>In a controlled burn chamber simulating open burning of scrap tires, a U.S. EPA report
estimated emissions of semivolatile organics ranged from 10 to 50 g/kg of tire material
burned. It is likely that emissions measured during this study characterize an actual
fire, but the similarity of actual gaseous concentrations and estimated emissions may not
be representative. The predominant emission products identified were monoaromatic and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The presence of benzo(a)pyrene in particulate extracts is
notable because of the compound&#146;s carcinogenicity. High emissions of other compounds,
particularly<strong> </strong>benzene, with concentrations often exceeding 1 ppm, may pose a
significant health risk. Zinc and<strong> </strong>lead in gaseous particulate was also verified and
quantified. (See paper for more specific emission data information.) </p>

<p>Examination and characterization experiments measuring emissions from combustion of
scrap tire material were performed in a rotary kiln incinerator simulator. These
experiments allowed controlled combustion where feed rates, temperatures, and oxygen
concentrations could be controlled and varied. Results indicated that, if burned in a
steady-state mode, tire-derived fuel combustion will result in very low emissions of
carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, volatile and semivolatile organics, and metal
aerosols. (See paper for more specific emission data information.) </p>

<p>Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) were
measured in ambient air during a burning tire fire. Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs in
ambient air, converted to toxicity equivalents (TEQ) by application of the International
Toxicity Equivalency Factors showed sites one kilometer (km) downwind of the fire were an
order of magnitude higher than at three kms downwind. Steer, <u>et.al</u>. reported that
measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
measured both in the plume and downwind of the source showed no PCDDs or PCDFs. </p>

	<h2>Potential Environmental Contamination</h2>
<p>Uncontrolled open tire burning poses potential environmental effects by contamination
of the soil, and ground and surface water. The two fire by-products, which pose a major
concern, are the generation of pyrolytic oil and ash. </p>

<p>Because of the starved-air conditions and the intense heat generated by an uncontrolled
tire fire, pyrolytic reactions occur, producing a free-flowing, oily tar. This pyrolytic
oil product consists of naphthalenes, anthracene, benzenes, thiazoles, amines, ethyl
benzene, toluene, and other hydrocarbons. Also included are metals such as cadmium,
chromium, nickel and zinc. This pyrolytic oil material can contaminate soil, and ground
and surface water surrounding the site. Maximum production of the pyrolytic oil material
occurs at about 200�C and exhibits properties similar to heating oil. In a field-scale
gasification reactor it was found that a greater portion of pyrolytic oil was produced at
the beginning of the process. Water applied to tire fires often increases the production
of pyrolytic oil and provides a method of transport for the oils to move off site and
accelerate contamination of soils and water. </p>

<p>Analyses of ash produced as a by-product of tire fires typically show the presence of
heavy metals. High concentrations of metals such as lead, cadmium, and zinc are not
uncommon. Fly ash has been shown to be rich in zinc, probably due to the fact that zinc is
found in the curing agent during tire manufacturing. </p>

<p>Laboratory analysis of soil samples taken from a tire fire in Bakersfield indicated the
total concentration of zinc exceeded the total threshold limit concentration (TTLC) [7800
mg/kg and 15800 mg/kg]. The TTLC for zinc is 5,000 mg/kg. Zinc concentrations at the
Panoche Waste Tire Site were also found to be extremely high (32,800-156,000 mg/kg).
Background zinc soil concentrations for the site averaged 64 mg/kg while underlying soil
beneath the ash concentrations ranged from 74 to 179 mg/kg. At the Rhinehart Tire Site
elevated levels of zinc were identified in surface water samples and on site soils. A
comparison of zinc levels in background sediments (93 ppm) with the highest zinc level
found on the site (2880 ppm) showed a significant increase. (See reports for more specific
emission data information.) </p>

<p>The fire at a used tire facility near Hagersville in Ontario, Canada was monitored by
the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy (MOEE) for impacts on the site and
surrounding environment. Soil samples collected during the fire did not show elevated PCDD
or PCDF concentrations. However, low concentrations of both compounds were detected in
vegetation collected at 100 meters and 200 meters from the site. PCDD and PCDF
concentrations in the foliage decreased with time but was still detectable for at least
200 days after the fire started. </p>

	<h2>Potential Health Hazards</h2>
<p>To evaluate worker protection at tire fires, two cases must be considered: potential
exposure while the fire is burning and potential exposure after the fire is out. This
evaluation considers what activities will be performed at the site and what substances are
present. A decision as to whether a health hazard exists is based on comparing emissions
estimates with established safe levels for those compounds. Based upon available
information, the following chemical hazards are of occupational concern. </p>

<p>While the fire is still burning, the smoke plume may contain hazardous substances that
should not be inhaled or allowed to contact the skin. The two substances for which
excessive exposure risk exists are believed to be polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide. </p>

<p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are a class of compounds consisting of various
arrangements and substitutions of multiple benzene rings. PAHs result mainly from the
incomplete combustion or high-temperature treatment of coal-derived materials. Since there
are no published exposure limits to PAHs, coal tar pitch volatile exposure values are
used. The coal tar pitch volatile (CTPV) is a &quot;benzene-soluble&quot; fraction of
total particulates that generally contains substances that have carcinogenic potential.
Epidemiological studies of the cancer mortality rates among those workers that have high
PAH exposure show an association with increased mortality from lung cancer. </p>

<p>Benzene compounds may be produced as part of the thermal breakdown and reformation of
molecules in the cooling process. Benzene may cause adverse health effects through
inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact. Acute exposure symptoms include dizziness,
euphoria, giddiness, headache, nausea, weakness, drowsiness, respiratory irritation,
pulmonary edema, and pneumonia. Benzene can also cause irritation to the skin, eyes, and
mucous membranes. </p>

<hr>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas usually resulting
from incomplete combustion. When inhaled, carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin to form
carboxyhemoglobin, which interferes with the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, resulting
in a state of tissue hypoxia. Typical signs and symptoms of acute CO poisoning are
headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, collapse, coma, and death. The amount
of carboxyhemoglobin formed is dependent on concentration and duration of exposure,
ambient temperature, health, and metabolism of the individual. </p>

<p>Other substances that pose a lesser exposure risk include metals and solvent vapors.
Airborne exposure to these substances in the plume may pose a health hazard. Employee
exposures to solvent vapors, except for benzene, have been shown to be well below
established exposure limits. Organic compounds typically found and of potential concern
include toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, and styrene. Aromatic hydrocarbons typically cause
central nervous system depression or other effects, and, depending on the compound,
hepatic, renal, or bone marrow disorders. </p>

<p>The presence of heavy metal compounds in the ash materials may also present a health
hazard concern. High concentrations of zinc, lead, or arsenic have been found in sample
analysis. Metals affect multiple organ systems, and the targets for toxicity are specific
biochemical processes and/or membranes of cells and organs. Dermal or skin contact with
contaminated materials should be avoided for these compounds. The metals act as primary
irritants by removing the surface film, disturbing the water-holding quality of the cells,
and injuring the membrane structure of the epidermal cells </p>

	<h2>Exposure Control Measures</h2>
<p>There are a number of hazards or potential hazards associated with open burning of
tires for field personnel outlined above. Control measures used are based upon the nature
of the harmful substance, its routes of exposure, and what job activities will be
performed at the site. To prevent potential exposure and to control exposure to hazards,
the measures listed below shall be considered. 

<ul>
  <li>Conduct preplanning to identify safety precautions prior to responding to a site or
    performing field activities. </li>
  <li>Avoid being in close proximity to the fire. </li>
  <li>Always select a safe place to observe. </li>
  <li>Do not touch or attempt to collect samples of soil, burn ash, or debris of any kind
    without appropriate personal protective equipment. </li>
  <li>Select personal protective equipment based on the hazards that will be encountered while
    at the site. Consult with the Health and Safety Officer and/or program staff. </li>
  <li>Use proper respiratory equipment to prevent inhalation of airborne hazards when
    appropriate. </li>
  <li>Never put notebooks or other equipment down in contaminated areas. </li>
  <li>Avoid the smoke plume. Stand upwind and out of the smoke plume area. </li>
  <li>Avoid ash, dust clouds, runoff, pyrolytic oils, tarry substances. </li>
  <li>Avoid walking in the burn site waste. </li>
  <li>Observe site conditions and wind direction. </li>
  <li>Keep vehicles away and upwind of all hazards and avoid contaminating the interior of
    vehicles. </li>
  <li>Avoid hand or body contact with contaminated materials or any contaminated surfaces. </li>
  <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with or without gloved hands. </li>
  <li>Decontaminate when leaving the site; wash hands and face. </li>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are potential health hazards associated with open tire burning. Tire combustion
poses an inhalation and dermal exposure risk for employees at the site. Airborne emission
information, especially in the smoke plume, has shown the presence of high concentrations
of carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Heavy metals contamination
of zinc and lead may present a dermal problem. Prior to performing field activities, Board
staff should consult with the Health and Safety Officer and/or program staff. The
information provided in this document is intended to supplement the information provided
in the Board&#146;s Field Health and Safety Program (Policy 1095-003). </p>

regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a>
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">11342.6</a>).
