    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong></p>

<p>This LEA advisory has been developed as guidance for changes in Public Resources Code
(PRC) section 44005 due to the enactment of Assembly Bill (AB) 59. Previously, when there
was a change in the operator of a solid waste facility (SWF) or disposal site, the new
operator was required to obtain a new Solid Waste Facilities Permit (SWFP), as this
document was nontransferable. </p>

<p><i><strong>Assembly Bill 59 amended PRC section 44005 to require:</strong></i> </p>

<h2>Operator Requirements </h2>

<p>A) Owners and/or operators of a SWF or disposal site who plan to sell, encumber,
transfer or convey the ownership or operation of the facility to a new owner or operator
must notify the enforcement agency (EA) and the California Integrated Waste Management
Board (CIWMB) 45 days prior to the transaction. Although this is similar to the previous
requirement for a change in owner, it significantly reduces the requirements for
incorporating a new operator into the SWFP. </p>

<p>B) The new owner or operator is required to submit specific information to the EA and
CIWMB and to meet specific requirements. The information and requirements are as follows: </p>

<p>1.&nbsp;Name(s), address(es), where notice can be sent and phone number(s) of the new
owner/operator;&nbsp; </p>

<p>2. Documentation that the new owner/operator meets the financial assurance and
operating liability requirements, when applicable; </p>

<p>3. A signed affidavit certifying that the owner/operator has read the governing permit
and conditioning documents and will operate in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the existing SWFP and conditioning documents and that all new information submitted is
correct; and </p>

<p>4. Amendments to the Report of Facility Information (RFI) which reflect the change in
owner/operator, and/or facility name. </p>

<p>C) All information provided pursuant to this advisory and PRC section 44005 shall not
be a matter of public record and shall be considered confidential until such time as the
owners have encumbered, sold, transferred or conveyed the property. </p>

<h2>Enforcement Agency's Processing </h2>

<p>The EA shall review the submitted notification documentation and any available records
to determine if the owner/operator has provided the required information and that the
facility is and will be able to operate within the terms and conditions of their permit
and RFI. If the owner/operator has satisfied all of the requirements, and the EA has
obtained written confirmation from the CIWMB that the new owner/operator is currently in
compliance with PRC 43040 and 43600 (operating liability and closure/postclosure
assurance), the EA shall notify the operator and CIWMB within 30 days of receipt of the
notification. </p>

<p>Upon notifying the operator and CIWMB that the notification is complete, the EA has 15
days to send the operator and CIWMB a copy of the changed permit, which reflects the
changes in the name of the owner/operator, and the address. This section does not
authorize the EA to change any other aspect of the SWFP without concurrence by the CIWMB
including the issuance date or permit review date. No other changes in the permit shall be
allowed to be made at this time without the owner/operator submitting an application for
revision. </p>

<p>An acceptable way of filing this change with the CIWMB is by adding an additional
box to the cover page of the permit titled &quot;Permit Transfer Date (pursuant to PRC
44005)&quot; with the new date of transfer. Attach the changed permit cover page (the new
permit which includes the new owner/operator). For clarity, the original permit could be
attached to the new permit cover page. See attachment for example of the Solid Waste Facilities
Permit cover page <a href="../../Forms/Permits/permitcover.doc">Word</a>
  (97/2000, 46 KB) or <a href="../../Forms/Permits/permitcover.pdf">PDF</a>
  (Adobe Acrobat, 11 KB). </p>

<p>If the EA determines that the owner/operator <strong>has not</strong> provided adequate
documentation or if the EA has reason to believe that the new owner or operator will be
operating outside the terms and conditions of the existing or governing SWFP, then the EA
shall inform the operator and the CIWMB in writing within 30 days of receipt of the
notification. The EA shall provide the basis for the owner/operator notification being
determined inadequate. </p>

<p>Attached is a 45-Day Owner/Operator Transfer Notice
form <a href="../../Forms/Permits/CIWMB675.xls">Excel</a>
(97/2000, 47 KB) or <a href="../../Forms/Permits/CIWMB675.pdf">PDF</a>
(Adobe Acrobat, 10 KB)<i> </i>that the owner/operator can use to submit the
change(s) to the EA. If used, the form would contain the information required by PRC
section 44005. This form is not required by regulation, therefore the EA may choose to use
or not to use the form. </p>

<h2>CIWMB Requirements </h2>

<p>Within 20 days of receipt of the notification, pursuant to CCR Title 27, section
21630, the CIWMB shall provide a written determination of the adequacy of the financial
assurances and operating liability demonstrations. </p>

<h2>Transferability of SWFP </h2>

<p>Many of the existing SWFPs have a standard language statement similar to: &quot;The
permit is granted solely to the operator named above, and is not transferable. Upon change
of the operator, the permit is subject to revocation or suspension.&quot; AB 59 supersedes
this requirement, and this condition should be removed from the SWFPs that are being
changed under this advisory, as well as SWFPs which are proposed by the EA from this time
forward. The only exceptions are when a Conditional Use Permit or California Environmental
Quality Act document makes such a requirement. Keep in mind that this statement was
standard language in the SWFP boilerplate, which was provided to EAs in the past. It is
recommended that this statement be deleted from any electronic copies which you may
possess and/or replace this statement with language consistent with the new law. </p>

<p>The use of the term &quot;notification&quot; in this advisory or AB 59 is not to be
confused with the use of notification in the tiered permitting regulations. </p>

<p>If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact your
Permitting and Inspection Branch representative. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties.
Guidance, for this purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s
regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a>
