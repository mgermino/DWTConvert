<h2>Title 27, Division 2, Subdivision 1, Chapter 3, Subchapter 4 </h2>

<h3>Article 2. Daily and Intermediate Cover &nbsp; </h3>

<p><strong>�20680. CIWMB Daily Cover.</strong> </p>

<p>(a) Except as provided in �(b) and �20690, or otherwise specified in 40 CFR Part 258,
the owners or operators of all municipal solid waste landfill units shall cover disposed
solid waste with a minimum of six inches of compacted earthen material at the end of each
operating day, or at more frequent intervals if necessary, to control vectors, fires,
odors, blowing litter, and scavenging. For the purposes of this section, the operating day
shall be defined as the hours of operation specified in the solid waste facility permit,
and may extend for more than 24 hours if operations are continuous. </p>

<p>(b) The EA, with concurrence by the CIWMB, may grant a temporary waiver from the
requirements of �(a) if the owner or operator demonstrates that there are extreme
seasonal climatic conditions that make meeting such requirements impractical. </p>

<p>(c) Earthen material or alternative cover<strong> </strong>materials of alternative thickness
shall be placed over all surfaces of disposed solid waste for other than municipal solid
waste landfill units, as required by the EA to control vectors, fires, odors, blowing
litter, and scavenging without presenting a threat to human health and the environment.
This requirement shall also apply to municipal solid waste landfills which qualify for a
delay in the general compliance date or additional flexibility as specified in 40 CFR Part
258.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(d) For the purposes of this section, earthen material shall include contaminated soil
as defined in Title 14, California Code of Regulations, �17361(b), and soil with
contaminants other than petroleum hydrocarbons which has been approved for use as landfill
daily cover by the RWQCB, and any other governmental agencies from which approval is
required, such as the Department of Toxic Substances Control and Air Pollution Control
District or Air Quality Management District.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(e) For waste classification, composition, and liquid percolation requirements of daily
cover, refer to the SWRCB requirements set forth in �20705 of this article.&nbsp; </p>

<p><i>Note: Authority cited: Section 40502, 43020, 43021, 43030 Public Resources Code.
Reference: Sections 40508, 42245, 43020, 43021 and 43103.<strong> </strong>Public Resources Code;
and Code of Federal Regulations Section 258.21(c).</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>(a) General Requirements </p>

<p>(1) Alternative materials of alternative thickness for daily cover (other than at least
six inches of earthen material) for municipal solid waste landfill units may be approved
by the EA with concurrence by the CIWMB, if the owner or operator demonstrates that the
alternative material and thickness control vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and
scavenging without presenting a threat to human health and the environment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(2) Alternative daily cover alone, or in combination with compacted earthen material,
shall be placed over the entire working face at the end of each operating day or at more
frequent intervals to control vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging
without presenting a threat to human health and the environment. For the purposes of this
section, the operating day shall be defined as the hours of operation specified in the
solid waste facility permit if operations are continuous.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(3) Should the application of alternative daily cover become impracticable or
contribute to conditions hazardous to public health and safety and the environment, the
owner or operator shall terminate such use and revert to the use of compacted earthen
cover material in accordance with �20680. For the purposes of this section, impracticable
conditions are those which make placement of alternative daily cover difficult due to
adverse climatic or other conditions such that the performance requirements of �(a)(2)
cannot be met.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(4) The owner or operator shall place compacted earthen material over the entire
working face at the end of any operating day preceding a period of time greater than 24
hours when the facility is closed, unless procedures as required by the EA are in place to
ensure that the requirements of �(a)(2) and (a)(3) are met. A stockpile of earthen cover
material and required equipment shall be available to ensure a corrective response to
violation of �(a)(2) and (a)(3).&nbsp; </p>

<p>(5) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of waste derived alternative daily
cover in accordance with Title 14, California Code of Regulations, �18800 et. seq., with
the addition of type and quantity of each waste derived alternative daily cover material
applied as cover. The records shall be available for inspection by authorized
representatives of the EA, the local health agency, and the CIWMB during normal business
hours and retained in the operating record near the site or in an alternative location
approved by the EA.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(6) For waste classification, composition, and liquid percolation requirements of
alternative daily cover, refer to the SWRCB requirements set forth in �20705.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(7) Waste derived materials used as alternative daily cover shall be restricted to
quantities no more than necessary to meet the performance requirements of �(a)(2), or as
specified in subdivision (b) of this section.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(8) Compost, co-compost, and chemically fixed sewage sludge, that meet the performance
standards for cover material, shall be limited to up to 25 percent of landfill cover
materials or landfill cover extenders as required under Public Resources Code (PRC) 42245.
For the purposes of this section, &quot;chemically fixed sewage sludge&quot; means solid
and semisolid residue generated during the treatment of domestic sewage. The 25 percent
limit shall apply on a quarterly basis to the total daily and intermediate cover or cover
extender use. For the purposes of this section, landfill cover extenders shall mean
compost, co-compost, or chemically fixed sewage sludge blended or mixed with soil.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(9) Storage and handling of waste derived materials at the landfill for use as
alternative daily cover shall be conducted in a manner to protect public health and safety
and the environment, and control vectors, fires, odors, and nuisances.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(10) The EA shall apply this section to disposal facilities other than municipal solid
waste landfill units as necessary to control vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and
scavenging without presenting a threat to human health and the environment. This
requirement shall also apply to municipal solid waste landfills which qualify for a delay
in the general compliance date or additional flexibility as specified in 40 CFR Part
258.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(b) Specific Requirements </p>

<p>Proposed uses of alternative daily cover materials not specified in � (b)(1) through
(10) shall be subject to site specific demonstration projects approved by the EA with

<p><strong>�20695. CIWMB Cover Performance Standards.</strong> </p>

<p>The EA may require the following cover performance standards if necessary to control
vectors, fires, odors, and blowing litter and to evaluate the suitability of alternative
daily or intermediate cover:&nbsp; </p>

<p>(a) <strong>Vectors</strong> </p>

<p>(1) Threshold Values-The following shall constitute threshold values for vector
populations: </p>

<p>(A) Flies-A fly grill survey value of six (6) or more domestic flies, or observations
of domestic flies in the &quot;crawler&quot; stage (newly emerged adults prior to wings
becoming functional) at a density of three (3) or more per square yard of surface area at
any location on the disposal area. Domestic flies are considered to be those species in
the Families: Muscidae (including Anthomyiidae), Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, and
Drosophilidae. </p>

<p>(B) Domestic Rats-The trapping of one or more domestic rats anywhere on the disposal
site. Domestic rats are considered to be any species in the genus Rattus. </p>

<p>(C) Field Rodents-Observation of five (5) or more field rodents feeding on the active
face of the disposal site. Field rodents are considered to be any species in the Family
Sciuridae. </p>

<p>(D) Mosquitoes-The observation of any immature mosquito stages from water holding waste
materials on the disposal site. </p>

<p>(E) Wasps, cockroaches, etc.-The observation of excessive populations utilizing
accepted norms. </p>

<p>(2) Inspection Practices </p>

<p>(A) Schedule- Fly grill surveys shall be conducted on each disposal site a minimum of
once per week. Sampling to determine the species composition of the fly population shall
be conducted a minimum of once per month. Rat trapping surveys shall be conducted at least
once each month. Observations for mosquitoes, wasps, cockroaches, &quot;crawler&quot;
flies or other types of vectors shall be made during each inspection of the disposal site.
The EA may approve alternative inspection schedules or cease inspections if previous
inspections or other observations indicate no further threat to public health and safety. </p>

<p>(B) Procedure-Ten (10) fly grill counts shall be made over appropriate attractants on
the active face of the disposal site during each inspection utilizing accepted practices
to count and record the flies. The five (5) highest counts shall be averaged to obtain the
value for that inspection. In sampling to provide qualitative data for the fly species
composition on a disposal site, any of the following or other acceptable method for
sampling adult flies shall be observed: </p>

<ul>
  <li>bait traps, exposed for at least a continuous 24-hour period at separate locations, or</li>
  <li>sticky tapes, exposed for a continuous 24-hour period at separate locations, or</li>
  <li>utilization of a standard insect net on the active working face, or</li>
  <li>other approved method to provide a representative sample.</li>
</ul>

<p>For uniformity of information, one of the approved methods shall be selected for use on
a continuing basis at each disposal site. </p>

<p>A minimum of two (2) domestic rat trap lines each containing twenty (20) traps shall be
operated for one night on each disposal site at the prescribed frequency. Traps
appropriately baited, shall be set at 20-foot intervals in each trap line. One trap line
shall be located on or as close to the active face as practical. The other trap line shall
be located on the periphery of the site in suitable rodent habitat. On very large sites
additional trap lines will be required to provide an adequate sample. Visual observations
of field rodents or their signs shall be made and recorded during each inspection. </p>

<p>(C) Equipment- All fly surveys conducted on the active face of the disposal site shall
be made with a Scudder fly grill. This device is a square grill consisting of 24 slats,
each 3' * 3/4&quot; * �&quot; placed 3/4&quot; apart on a Z-shaped framework. Species
composition of fly populations at the site shall be made with the use of fly traps, sticky
tapes, an insect net, or other approved method to provide a representative sample. Snap
traps or live traps, or a combination thereof, of suitable size and design shall be used
to capture mature domestic rats. </p>

<p>(D) Records- The following information shall be recorded at a minimum during each
inspection: Name of site; location; date of inspection; name of person(s) making the
inspection; the time the inspection began; the time the inspection ended; temperature;
wind conditions; moisture conditions; sky conditions; shade; attractants<strong>, </strong>when
applicable; results of the 10 Scudder grill counts; number and species of all flies
captured; number of domestic rats trapped since the previous inspection; number of field
rodents observed (or signs of their presence), and the presence of any mosquitoes, wasps,
cockroaches, or other types of vectors. These records shall be kept up to date and shall
be submitted to the EA upon request.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(b) <strong>Fire</strong> </p>

<p>Burning material, or any solid waste at a temperature likely to cause fire, shall not
be deposited in the fill. Said material shall initially be deposited in a separate
location a sufficient distance from the fill area to prevent fires from spreading to the
normal fill area. It shall then be spread in a single layer not exceeding one (1) foot in
thickness and immediately covered with a sufficient amount of earth or sprayed with
sufficient fire retardant to extinguish all combustion. Final disposition of the material
shall not take place until the operator is certain that no further combustion will take
place under any conditions. </p>

<p>Fires which originate within the fill shall be handled by removing all the burning
material from the fill and extinguishing it as described above, or by in-situ practices
approved by the EA, in consultation with the local fire authority. Excavation of burning
materials shall be undertaken in a planned and controlled manner; with sufficient fire
fighting equipment present to control any &quot;flare-ups&quot; which may occur as outside
air reaches the burning materials. The EA shall be immediately notified of any fire. </p>

<p>(c) <strong>Litter</strong> </p>

<p>Accumulation or offsite migration of litter in quantities that create a nuisance,
injury to the public and personnel, or cause other problems, shall be prevented.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(d) <strong>Alternative Methods</strong> </p>

<p>Alternative cover performance standards in lieu of �(a) through (c) of this section
may be applied by the EA with concurrence by the CIWMB. </p>

<p><i>NOTE: Authority Cited: Section 40502, 41781.3, Public Resources Code. Reference:
Sections 40508, 43020, 43021 and 43103, Public Resources Code; and Code of Federal
Regulations Section 258.21.</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>�20700. CIWMB Intermediate Cover.&nbsp;</strong> </p>

<p>(a) Compacted earthen material at least twelve (12) inches shall be placed on all
surfaces of the fill where no additional solid waste will be deposited within 180 days to
control vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(b) Alternative materials of alternative thickness (other than at least twelve inches
of earthen material) for intermediate cover may be approved by the EA with concurrence by
the CIWMB, if the owner or operator demonstrates that the alternative material and
thickness control vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging without presenting
a threat to human health and the environment.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(c) For waste classification, composition, and liquid percolation requirements of
intermediate cover and alternative intermediate cover, refer to the SWRCB requirements set
forth in �20705 of this article.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(d) Proposed use of alternative intermediate cover shall be subject to site specific
demonstration to establish suitability as intermediate cover. Demonstration projects shall
be approved by the EA with concurrence by the CIWMB.&nbsp; </p>

Sections 40508, 43020, 43021 and 43103, Public Resources Code; and Code of Federal
Regulations Section 258.21.</i>&nbsp; </p>

<h3>SWRCB Requirements for Daily and Intermediate Cover: </h3>

<p>Title 27, Division 2, Subdivision 1, Chapter 3, Subchapter 4 </p>

<p>Article 2. Daily and Intermediate Cover </p>

<p>�<strong>20705</strong>. SWRCB Standards for Daily and Intermediate (Interim) Cover. </p>

<p>(a) Daily &amp; Intermediate- Interim cover at landfills is &quot;daily cover&quot; and
&quot;intermediate cover&quot; as defined by the CIWMB (see �20160). </p>

<p>(b) Minimize Percolation- Interim cover over wastes discharged to a landfill shall be
designed and constructed to minimize percolation of liquids through wastes. </p>

<p>(c) For Class II Waste Piles- Cover may be required by RWQCBs for Class II wastes piles
</p>

<p>(d) [Reserved] </p>

<p>(e) Limitations On Cover Materials- Except for reusable covers that are never
incorporated into the Unit, daily and intermediate cover shall only consist of materials: </p>

<p>(1) Match Unit Classification- which meet the classification criteria for wastes that
can be discharged to that landfill. Therefore, a material that would be classified as a
designated waste cannot be utilized for daily or intermediate cover at a Class III
landfill unless that material is approved for discharge (as a waste) to that landfill
pursuant to �20200(a)(1); and&nbsp; </p>

<p>(2) Composition- whose constituents (other than water) and foreseeable breakdown
byproducts, under the chemical (including biochemical) and temperature conditions which it
is likely to encounter within the landfill, either:&nbsp; </p>

<p>(A) for non-composite lined portions of the Unit, are mobilized only at concentrations
which would not adversely affect beneficial uses of waters of the state, in the event of a
release; or&nbsp; </p>

<p>(B) for composite-lined portions of the Unit, are listed as COC&#146;s in the
Unit&#146;s water quality protection standard (Water Standard), created pursuant to
�20395.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(f) Dust Control- The requirements of �21090(a)(5) regarding the discharge of
leachate, gas condensate, and other liquids to final covered portions of the Unit also
apply to the discharge of liquids to daily and intermediate cover, including discharges
made for the purpose of dust control. </p>

<p><strong>Excerpted Portion of Disposal Reporting Regulations for Landfills</strong>: </p>

<p>Title 14, Division 7, Chapter 9&nbsp; </p>

<p>Article 9.2. Disposal Reporting System.&nbsp; </p>

<p>�<strong>18810.</strong> Disposal Reporting Requirements for a Landfill.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The following requirements shall apply to an operator of a permitted landfill:&nbsp; </p>

<p>(a) An operator shall determine the total number of tons of solid waste disposed in
each quarter. The tons disposed shall be the same number of tons reported to the Board of
Equalization that are subject to the fee pursuant to Section 48000 of the Public Resources
Code and Section 45151 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(b) An operator shall determine the origin of solid waste during the origin survey
weeks. An operator shall conduct origin surveys during the origin survey weeks set in
Section 18805. </p>

<p>(1) If a facility accepts solid waste from only one jurisdiction, the operator shall
assign all the waste to that jurisdiction. </p>

<p>(2) If an attendant is not present during regular hours of operation, and one cannot be
present for the survey weeks set by the agency pursuant to Section 18805, and the operator
does not receive origin information from the haulers delivering waste, then the operator
shall assign the waste to the jurisdiction in which the facility is located. </p>

<p>(3) If a facility accepts solid waste from more than one jurisdiction, the operator
shall do the following steps in order: </p>

<p>(A) Obtain information on the jurisdiction(s) of origin for each vehicle load,
including self-hauled waste, delivered to the facility on the dates set by the agency
pursuant to Section 18805. If solid waste is delivered to the facility and information on
the jurisdiction of origin is not provided by the delivering hauler or operator as
specified in this Article, then the operator shall assign the waste to the jurisdiction in
which the facility is located by labeling it as &quot;host assigned&quot; waste. </p>

<p>Example: Four loads delivered during the survey week. </p>

<p>Load 1 = 5 tons from City A </p>

<p>Load 2 = 5 tons from City B </p>

<p>Load 3 = 10 tons from City C </p>

<p>Load 4 = 5 tons from City B </p>

<p>(B) Calculate the tons of solid waste assigned to each jurisdiction during the survey
week. The operator shall either add up the amounts accepted from each jurisdiction, or the
amounts of solid waste from each jurisdiction after adjusting for diversion activity at
the landfill. </p>

<p>Example: City A = 5 tons (Load 1) </p>

<p>City B = 10 tons (Load 2 + Load 4) </p>

<p>City C = 10 tons (Load 3) </p>

<p>(C) Calculate the percentage of waste assigned to each jurisdiction during the survey
week by dividing the tons determined in paragraph (B) by the total tons of waste for the
survey period. </p>

<p>Example: 25 tons delivered during survey week. </p>

<p>City A = 5 tons/25 tons = 0.2 (20%) </p>

<p>City B = 10 tons/25 tons = 0.4 (40%) </p>

<p>City C = 10 tons/25 tons = 0.4 (40%) </p>

<p>(D) Calculate the number of tons disposed from each jurisdiction during the quarter by
multiplying the percentage from paragraph (C) with the total number of tons of solid waste
disposed in each quarter from subsection (a). </p>

<p>Example: 1000 tons disposed during quarter. </p>

<p>City A = 0.2 x 1000 tons = 200 tons </p>

<p>City B = 0.4 x 1000 tons = 400 tons </p>

<p>City C = 0.4 x 1000 tons = 400 tons&nbsp; </p>

<p>(c) During the entire quarter, an operator shall record the jurisdiction of origin for
all alternative daily cover material used. An operator shall also record the types and
quantities of material being used as alternative daily or intermediate<strong> </strong>cover.&nbsp;
</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) An operator shall provide the following information to the agency
in which the facility is located: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) facility name and Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) number, </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) the reporting quarter and year, </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) the total tons disposed at the facility, </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4) the total tons from each jurisdiction disposed, </p>

<p>(5) the total tons of<strong> </strong>each type of alternative daily or intermediate<strong> </strong>cover<strong>
</strong>from each jurisdiction used at the landfill,<strong> </strong>and </p>

<p>(6) a brief summary of the methods used to determine the jurisdictions of origin.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>(e) The operator shall provide this information to the agency by the due dates in
