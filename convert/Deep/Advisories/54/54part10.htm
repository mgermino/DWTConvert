<p>27 CCR §20918 Exemptions</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>A disposal site other than a MSWLF unit, may be granted an exemption to all or any
  portion of the requirements of Article 6 of this Subchapter if the operator can
  demonstrate to the satisfaction of the of the EA, that there is no potential for adverse
  impacts on the public health and safety and the environment, based upon but not limited
  to: the amount, nature and age of refuse; projected gas generation; and remoteness of the
  facility. Exemptions and alternatives shall be reviewed by the EA in conjunction with the
  five (5) year permit review, and based on the results, the EA may extend or terminate the
  exemption. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This standard applies only to active non-MSWLF units. This standard requires that the
operator make this demonstration only to the EA for evaluation of exemption status from
this standard.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20919 Gas Control</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where the Enforcement Agency, the local fire control authority, or the CIWMB has cause
  to believe a hazard or nuisance may be created by landfill decomposition gases, they shall
  so notify the owner. Thereafter, the site owner shall cause the site to be monitored for
  presence and movement of gases, and shall take necessary action to control such gases. The
  site owner shall inform the operator of any actions ordered by the EA, the local fire
  control authority or the CIWMB concerning gas control methods. The monitoring program
  shall be developed pursuant to the specifications of the above agencies. The monitoring
  program shall not be discontinued until authorized to do so in writing by the requiring
  agency. Results of the monitoring shall be submitted to the appropriate agencies. If
  monitoring indicates methane gas movement away from the site, the owner shall, within a
  period of time specified by the requiring agency, construct a gas control system approved
  by that agency. The agency may waive this requirement if satisfactory evidence is
  presented indicating that adjacent properties are safe from hazard or nuisance caused by
  methane gas movement. The operator shall duly inform the disposal site owner of possible
  landfill gas problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 27 CCR §20919.5 requires gas monitoring and control only at MSWLFs this standard
on Gas Control may be applied to non-MSWLFs. If the inspector believes that there is a gas
problem at a landfill that falls under this standard, those requirements outlined in 27
CCR §20919.5 may be used as a guideline for gas monitoring and control.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20919.5 Explosive Gases Control</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Owners or operators of all MSWLF units must ensure that::</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) The concentration of methane gas generated by the facility does not exceed 25
    percent of the lower explosive limit for methane in facility structures (excluding gas
    control or recovery system components); and</p>
    <p>(2) The concentration of methane gas does not exceed the lower explosive limit for
    methane at the facility property boundary.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(b) Owners or operators of all MSWLF units must implement a routine methane-monitoring
  program to ensure that the standards of paragraph (a) are met.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) The type and frequency of monitoring must be determined based on the following
    factors:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(i) soil conditions;</p>
        <p>(ii) the hydrogeologic conditions surrounding the facility;</p>
        <p>(iii) the hydraulic conditions surrounding the facility; and</p>
        <p>(iv) the location of facility structures and property boundaries.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(2) The minimum frequency of monitoring shall be quarterly.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(c) If methane gas levels exceeding the limits specified in paragraph (a) of this
  section are detected, the owner or operator must:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Immediately take all necessary steps to ensure protection of human health and
    notify the EA;</p>
    <p>(2) Within seven days of detection, place in the operating record the methane gas
    levels detected and a description of the steps taken to protect human health; and</p>
    <p>(3) Within 60 days of detection, implement a remediation plan for the methane gas
    releases, place a copy of the plan in the operating record, and notify the EA that the
    plan has been implemented. The plan shall describe the nature and extent of the problem
    and the proposed remedy.</p>
    <p>(4) The EA with concurrence by the CIWMB pursuant to 40 CFR 258.23 (c) (4) may
    establish alternative schedules for demonstrating compliance with paragraphs (c)(2) and
    (3) of this section.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(d) For purposes of this section, &quot;lower explosive limit&quot; means the lowest
  percent by volume of a mixture of explosive gases in air that will propagate a flame at 25
  degrees Celsius and atmospheric pressure.</p>
  <p>(e) The EA shall forward notifications and approvals pursuant to 20919.5(c)(1) and
  (c)(3) to the CIWMB pursuant to 40 CFR 258.23(c)(1) and (c)(3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table of Contents</a></p>

<p>Actions required to be taken by the operator are stated in the regulation. The methane
gas monitoring program should be approved by the EA. CIWMB staff may be contacted for
assistance in reviewing the program. The EA should evaluate this standard at active solid
waste landfills by (1) using a CGI to measure methane levels in appropriate gas probes and
barholes on a monthly basis, or (2) overseeing the operator's quarterly monitoring by
observing the monitoring, verifying a representative portion of the operator's findings
with LEA gas monitoring instrumentation, and documenting the date of the monitoring and
any findings on a SWIS inspection report to the CIWMB Permitting and Inspection Branch
contact. Actions taken at MSWLFs to mitigate gas problems include installation of landfill
gas monitoring systems approved by the LEA and/or the CIWMB, installation of landfill gas
control systems, installation of structural gas control systems, sealing floor cracks of
on-site structures, improving ventilation, removal of the structure(s), and purchasing
contiguous property as a buffer zone.</p>

<p>Landfill gas may contain potentially harmful trace constituents. See Appendix M for a
listing of prevalent trace gases from Class III MSWLFs. Chronic exposure to these
constituents may result in health problems.</p>

<p>The lower explosive limit (LEL) of a combustible gas is the lowest concentration of
that gas by volume in air that will explode, ignite, or burn when there is an ignition
source. For methane the LEL is 5 percent. The upper explosive limit (UEL) is the highest
concentration of gas that will explode, ignite, or burn with an ignition source present.
For methane the UEL is 15 percent. Below the LEL there is insufficient fuel to support
explosion. Above the UEL there is insufficient oxygen to support explosion. However, care
should be taken as a small dilution with air can bring the level back to an explosive
concentration.</p>

<p>A violation should be noted if any of the following are found during the inspection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1) Concentrations of methane exceed 5 percent or greater by volume in air at the
      facility property boundary, or 1.25 percent or greater by volume in air in on-site
      structures, including underground chambers.</p>
      <i><strong><p>Note: </strong></i>&quot;Facility property boundary&quot; means the boundary
      designated in the SWFP for the site and does not apply to all the land owned by the
      operator that may be adjacent to the permitted boundary of the facility. The 5 percent
      methane level requirement at the &quot;facility property boundary&quot; does not apply to
      unpermitted disposal sites. However, §17705&#150;Gas Control can be applied at
      unpermitted sites for methane gas levels above the LEL.</p>
      <p>2) A routine methane-monitoring program is not implemented with a minimum of quarterly
      frequency.</p>
      <p>3) The operator has not taken the required measures when methane exceeds the limits
      specified above.</p>
      <p>4) The operator has not complied with the alternative schedule requirement of this
      standard.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>An area of concern should be noted if the combustible gas concentration in an on-site
structure is between 100 ppm and 12,500 ppm (1.25 percent or 25 percent of the LEL).</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> Gas monitoring results and any remediation plans must be placed in the
operating record §20515&#150;Recordkeeping Requirements.</p>

<p>The inspector should make the above determinations with appropriate instrumentation.
Monitoring at the property boundary should be done initially using either a bar hole
punch, existing property boundary landfill gas monitoring probes, or a combination of the
two. When a gas migration problem is suspected at the site boundary where no landfill gas
monitoring probes have been installed, and despite readings below 5 percent by volume in
air in bar holes, the EA should measure methane levels at greater depths. The LEA may
request that CIWMB staff use its gas vapor probe equipment to measure combustible gas
concentrations to a depth of 20 feet or more, depending on site geology. The EA should
follow up on violations of this section, and require the operator to take adequate steps
to monitor and control gas. For purposes of this standard &quot;at&quot; means as close to
the property boundary as possible, but within several feet. The LEA may request CIWMB
assistance with technical review of landfill gas control plans.</p>

<p>If an air quality problem is observed or suspected, the inspector should communicate
all concerns to the appropriate AQMD or APCD. Problems include excessive landfill gas
emissions, odors, dust, or emissions from landfill gas destruction equipment. In cases
where the AQMD has a corrective action order, the AQMD coordinates with the EA in the
design of the system.</p>

<p>Please refer to LEA Advisory #44 for comprehensive information on gas monitoring
procedures.</p>

<h3><a name="Closure">Closure</a></h3>

<p>LEAs are also encouraged to contact their Remediation, Closure and Technical Services
Branch staff person for assistance in inspecting closed sites, or those in the process of
closing, pursuant to the closure requirements of 27 CCR, Subdivision 1, Chapter 3,
Subchapter 5, Article 2. A separate LEA advisory for closure site inspections will be
provided in the future.<i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §21780 Submittal of Closure Plans</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Each submittal shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or a certified
  engineering geologist. Each submittal shall include:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) The preliminary or final closure and postclosure maintenance plans containing all
    of the elements specified under §21790 through §21840 as applicable.</p>
    <p>(2) Updated cost estimates for closure and postclosure activities to reflect the
    components under §21820 and §21840.</p>
    <p>(3) An updated demonstration of financial responsibility in accordance with Subchapter
    2 of Chapter 6 (§22205 et seq.). This demonstration shall reflect the updated cost
    estimates for closure and postclosure activities required under ¶(a)(2). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(b) The operator shall submit two copies of each document to the EA, the RWQCB and the
  local air district. All drawings shall be submitted at an appropriate scale that clearly
  shows all pertinent features. The closure and postclosure maintenance plans shall be
  clearly marked &quot;preliminary&quot; or &quot;final&quot;, depending on the status. For
  partial final closure, those sections submitted pursuant to §21800, shall be clearly
  marked &quot;partial final.&quot;</p>
  <p>(c) Plans for complete site closure of a solid waste landfill shall be submitted in
  accordance with the following schedule:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Preliminary closure and postclosure maintenance plans for existing solid waste
    landfills shall be submitted as part of the JTD or as a separate document at the time of
    application for each SWFP review or revision;</p>
    <p>(2) preliminary closure and postclosure maintenance plans for new landfills not
    operating prior to the effective date of the regulations shall be submitted as part of the
    JTD at the time of application for a SWFP. For the purposes of this subchapter, lateral
    expansions of landfills are considered new municipal solid waste landfills.</p>
    <p>(3) final closure and postclosure maintenance plans for solid waste landfills shall be
    submitted two years prior to the anticipated date of closure. Within five years of the
    anticipated date of closure, the operator may submit the final closure and postclosure
    maintenance plans in lieu of submitting new or updated preliminary closure and postclosure
    maintenance plans.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(d) Partial final closure of a solid waste landfill shall be allowed in accordance with
  the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) for the complete closure of discrete units, partial final closure and postclosure
    maintenance plans shall be submitted for each unit 2 years prior to the anticipated date
    of closure of that discrete unit in accordance with §21800 and §21830. Closure of such a
    discrete unit shall not commence until approval of the partial final closure and
    postclosure maintenance plans for that discrete unit. The specific closure details for
    each discrete unit shall be compatible with closure of the entire landfill; and </p>
    <p>(2) for the implementation of any one or a combination of individual final closure
    activities, partial final closure and postclosure maintenance plans for the activities
    shall be approved before implementation of such closure activities.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(e) If immediate closure of a disposal site is necessary to protect public health and
  safety and the environment, closure plans shall be submitted in accordance with a schedule
  specified by the EA. An emergency corrective action plan may be required by the EA, to be
  submitted for approval by the EA. The emergency corrective action plan may be implemented
  prior to the submittal of the closure plan.</p>
  <p>(f) The owner or operator of a MSWLF unit shall notify the EA that closure and
  postclosure maintenance plans have been prepared and placed in the operating record in
  accordance with 40 CFR 258.60(d) and 258.61(d)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For additional guidance on submittal of closure and postclosure maintenance plans LEAs
should communicate with their Remediation, Closure and Technical Services Branch staff
contact. A separate LEA advisory for closure/postclosure plan submittal will be provided
in the future.</p>
