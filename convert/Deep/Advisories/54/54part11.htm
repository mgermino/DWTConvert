<p></i>Article 5.5. <a name="Waste Tire Storage and Disposal Standards at Landfills">Waste
Tire Storage and Disposal Standards at Landfills</a><br />
14 CCR §17350 Scope.</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Any solid waste facility storing 500 or more waste tires or a major or minor waste
  tire facility which stores waste tires outdoors must comply with the technical and
  operational standards in sections 17351 through 17355 of this Article. Any facility that
  stores waste tires indoors must comply with the technical and operational standards in
  section 17356 of this Article. Waste tires that are disposed of by burying at a solid
  waste facility are addressed in section 17355 of this article.</p>
  <p>(b) This article shall not apply to any facility that meets the requirements of section
  18420(b) or (c) of Article 1, Chapter 6 of this Division.<i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: </i>This standard outlines the scope of tire standards and is not included on the
SWIS inspection form.</p>

<p>Facilities excluded under §18420(b) and (c) include certain businesses that retread or
remold recyclable tires, or resell recyclable tires. This exclusion does not apply to
solid waste landfills that store tires prior to disposal on site or shipment off site of
unprocessed tires.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>14 CCR §17351 Fire Prevention Measures</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Communication equipment shall be maintained at all facilities, if they are staffed
  by an attendant to ensure that the site operator can contact local fire protection
  authorities in the event of fire.</p>
  <p>(b) Adequate equipment to aid in the control of fires must be provided and maintained
  at the facility at all times. At a minimum the following items shall be maintained on site
  and in working order at all times:</p>
  <p>(1) dry chemical fire extinguisher;</p>
  <p>(2) One (1) two and one-half gallon water extinguisher;</p>
  <p>(3) One (1) pike pole at least 10 feet in length; and</p>
  <p>(4) One (1) round point and one (1) square point shovel.</p>
  <p>(c) An adequate water supply shall be available for use by the local fire authority.
  The water supply shall be capable of delivering at least 1000 gallons per minute for a
  duration of at least three hours and at least 2000 gallons per minute for a duration of at
  least three hours if the sum of altered plus whole waste tires exceeds 10,000.</p>
  <p>(d) All of the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) shall apply unless the local
  fire authority having jurisdiction over a particular facility determines that a different
  requirement is necessary or adequate to meet the intent of these regulations for fire
  control and the protection of life and property. This may include the availability of
  earth moving equipment or other approved means to control the tire fire. Any change in, or
  any new, local fire authority requirements that affect the requirements in the Article
  shall be reported to the Board by the operator within 30 days after their effective date.
  Any requirements approved by the local fire authority shall be subject to Board
  concurrence at the time of issuance or renewal of the permit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspector should ask to be shown the communications and firefighting equipment as
specified above.</p>

<p>The inspector should evaluate compliance with subsections (b) and (c) by looking for a
fire hydrant that serves the property and check with local building and safety and fire
departments for records of fire hydrant installations and specifications. If there is no
fire hydrant for use by the operator or the local fire authority states that the water
supply is inadequate and the operator is not working to upgrade the supply, a violation of
this standard exists (unless the local fire authority has approved a different requirement
in writing, such as the use of earth moving equipment in lieu of a water supply). </p>

<p>At facilities where a fire hydrant is unavailable, the inspector should look for an
approved alternate source of water for firefighting purposes. In most instances a water
storage tank holding a specific amount of water will have been approved by the local fire
authority and the CIWMB. Since other arrangements may be approved by the local fire
authority and the CIWMB, the inspector should check for approval of any alternative
source(s) of water or alternatives to a water supply for fire fighting. Whenever the
facility operator is permitted under approved alternative local fire authority
requirements, but is not complying with them, a violation of this standard exists.</p>

<p>Compliance with subsection (d) of this standard may be evaluated by contacting the
local fire authority and the CIWMB's Tire Unit during the preinspection workup.</p>

    <strong>

<p>14 CCR §17352 Facility Access and Security</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Signs - a sign shall be posted at the facility entrance stating the name of the
  operator, if the facility receives tires from sources other than the operator of the site,
  operating hours, and site rules.</p>
  <p>(b) Attendant - An attendant shall be present when the facility is open for business if
  the facility receives tires from persons other than the operator of the facility.</p>
  <p>(c) Access - An access road to the facility must be maintained passable for emergency
  equipment and vector control vehicles at all times. Unauthorized access to the waste tire
  storage area of the facility must be strictly controlled through the use of industrial
  fencing and gates, or other means of access control.</p>
</blockquote>

    <strong>

<p>Signs.</strong> Determine if the facility receives waste tires from sources other than the
operator of the site, as these facilities are required to post a sign. This would be
apparent if the operator charges a fee to take waste tires from other sources. Waste tires
generated by a tire repair shop or store owned and operated by the operator of the waste
tire facility (WTF) are not considered to be tires from another source(s).</p>
<strong>

<p>Attendant.</strong> Ask the attendant if he/she directs customers to the tire unloading
area. Also, ask the attendant if training has been provided regarding fire safety and fire
fighting.</p>
<strong>

<p>Access.</strong> Look for access to the waste tire storage area and determine if it is
passable to emergency vehicles, including full-sized fire engines. The inspector may elect
to contact the local fire authority on this matter. The road should be wide, smooth, and
firm enough for the widest and heaviest emergency vehicles to drive over in wet weather
without becoming stuck. Inspect fencing or other physical restraints around the storage
area that discourage unauthorized entry. Any signs of a breach in the security structure
should be noted. Look for locks on the gates and ascertain whether the local fire
authority and local vector control authority have keys to the locks.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>14 CCR §17353 Vector Control Measures</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) All waste tires shall be stored in a manner which prevents the breeding and
  harborage of mosquitoes, rodents, and other vectors by any of the following means:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Cover with impermeable barriers other than soil to prevent entry or accumulation of
    precipitation; or</p>
    <p>(2) Use of treatments or methods to prevent or eliminate vector breeding 
    as necessary, provided the control program is approved as appropriate and 
    effective by the local vector control authority, if such authority exists. 
    If no local vector control authority exists, the local health department and 
    the State Department of Health Services shall approve the vector control 
    plan. Any control program approved by the local vector control authority 
    shall be subject to Board concurrence at the time of issuance or renewal of 
    the permit.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Waste tire stockpiles should be checked for conformance with an approved vector control
plan, unless the stockpiles are covered with an impermeable cover, other than soil, that
will prevent the accumulation of precipitation in the tires. The inspector should note
ponded water and mosquito breeding in stockpiled waste tires at the facility. If vectors
are seen among the tire stockpiles during the inspection a violation is probably
warranted. Evidence of rodents, such as burrows and rodent droppings, should be given an
area of concern. Documentation of past vector control inspections should be requested. If
the vector control plan requires spraying, etc. ask to see a receipt or other
documentation.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>14 CCR §17354 Storage of Waste Tires</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (c) waste tires shall be restricted to individual
  tire storage units that do not exceed 5000 square feet of contiguous area. Any pile shall
  not exceed 50,000 cubic feet in volume nor 10 feet in height. Tire storage units shall not
  exceed 6 feet in height when within 20 feet of any property line. Waste tires shall not be
  located within 10 feet of any property line. The minimum distance between waste tires and
  structures that are located either on-site or off-site shall be as specified in Table I.</p>
  <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) waste tires shall be separated from vegetation
  and other potentially flammable materials by no less than 40 feet. Accessible fire lanes
  with a minimum width as specified in Table I shall be provided between tire storage units.
  Fire lanes shall be kept free of flammable or combustible material and vegetation. Access
  to fire lane(s) for emergency vehicles must be unobstructed at all times. Open flames,
  blow torches, or highly flammable materials, including but not limited to, tire inner
  tubes, are prohibited within 40 feet of a waste tire pile.<strong><i></p>

  <i><p></i>(c) All of the requirements in subsections (a) and (b) shall apply to the
  storage of waste tires unless, for any particular requirement, the local fire authority
  having jurisdiction over a particular facility determines that a different requirement is
  necessary or adequate to meet the intent of these regulations for the prevention of fire
  and the protection of life and property. Any change in, or any new, local fire authority
  requirements that affect the requirements in this Article shall be reported to the Board
  by the operator within 30 days after their effective date. Any requirements approved by
  the local fire authority shall be subject to Board concurrence at the time of issuance or
  renewal of the permit.</p>
  <p>(d) Surface water drainage shall be directed around and away from the waste tire
  storage area.</p>
  <p>(e) Waste tires at existing waste tire facilities shall not be stored on surfaces with
  grades that will interfere with fire fighting equipment or personnel unless mitigation
  measures have been approved in writing by the local fire authority, or a fire safety
  engineer registered by the State of California. Measures established by a fire safety
  engineer shall be subject to approval by the local fire authority.</p>
  <p>(f) New waste tire facilities shall not:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Be sited in any area where they may be subjected to immersion in water during a
    100-year storm unless the operator demonstrates to the Board that the facility will be
    designed and operated so as to prevent waste tires from migrating off-site; or</p>
    <p>(2) Be located on sites with grades or other physical features that will interfere with
    fire fighting equipment or personnel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(g) Tires must be removed from rims immediately upon arrival at the facility.</p>
  <p>(h) The site shall be designed and constructed to provide protection to bodies of water
  from runoff of pyrolytic oil resulting from a potential tire fire.</p>
</blockquote>

  <strong>

<p>Setbacks.</strong> For each waste tire unit the inspector should make sure that the distance
to the nearest structure, either on or off the property, is equal to or greater than the
particular distance specified for fire lanes in Table 1.</p>
<strong>

<p>Measurement.</strong> Measurements (length, width, and height) of each waste tire unit must
be obtained. This can be done using a steel tape measure or a hip chain unit. It is good
practice to have someone available to assist in measuring large waste tire units. When
practicable, the height of waste tire piles should be measured directly using a steel tape
measure or yardstick. Direct measurement of the height of the waste tire unit should be
done when the top of the tire pile is within reach of the inspector while standing at the
base of the unit.</p>

<p>When measurement of the height of a waste tire pile is impracticable and unreliable
indirect means of measuring should be employed. The height of a waste tire unit can be
measured indirectly in one of the following ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><strong><p>Method 1.</strong></i> Step off a known distance from the pile and measure the angle
    between eye level and the top of the tire pile at that point. See Figure 1 (next page). A
    clinometer can be used to measure the angle. Record the known distance from the pile
    (distance &quot;a&quot;) and the angle measured (angle &quot;<font FACE="Symbol">a</font>
    &quot;). Double the known distance from the waste tire unit (&quot;2a&quot;) and take a
    second angle measurement at that point (&quot;<font FACE="UniversalMath1 BT">b</font>
    &quot;). Record this angle. Calculate the height of the pile using the following formula:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <font SIZE="2"><p>Tire pile height (h) = <u>a (tangent <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> )
      (tangent <font FACE="UniversalMath1 BT">b</font> )</u> + eye level ht.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      tangent <font FACE="Symbol">a</font> - tangent <font FACE="UniversalMath1 BT">b</font> </p>
      </font>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <strong><i><p>Method 2.</i></strong> Walk off a straight distance from the waste tire unit
  equivalent to 3 times the inspector&#146;s height to eye level. See Figure 2. Standing at
  this distance facing the tire unit, the inspector can measure the angle between eye level
  and the top of the pile as shown in Method 1 above. This is angle &quot; a .&quot; The
  following formula may be used to compute the height (h) of the pile:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>h = (3X inspectors height X tangent a ) + eye level ht.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <strong><p>Method 2 of measuring tire pile height indirectly.</p>
  </strong><blockquote>
    <p>Example 2: Eye level = 5.5' . Three times this distance is 16.5' . The angle at 16.5'
    from the base of the tire stockpile is 25<font FACE="UniversalMath1 BT">8</font> .
    Therefore, the tire pile height is calculated to be:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>h = (16.5<font FACE="Symbol">¢</font> x tangent 25<sup>o</sup>) + 5.5<font FACE="Symbol">¢</font> </p>
        <p>= (16.5' x 0.466) + 5.5<font FACE="Symbol">¢</font> </p>
        <p>= 13.2<font FACE="Symbol">¢</font> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the height of the tire pile is determined, the area and volume of each waste
storage unit can then be calculated.</p>

<p>The distance from the waste tire units to the property lines and the height of the
piles within 20 feet of the property lines should be measured. If any of the measurements
or calculations in subsections (a) or (b) of this section do not conform to the
regulations, the inspector should determine if the local fire authority has given written
approval for activities that do not conform to the regulations. If the local fire
authority has issued written requirements other than the regulations the stockpiles must
be evaluated for compliance with those requirements.</p>

<p>If, during the preinspection contact with the local fire authority, that agency's staff
state that they have ordered the operator to implement new or amended fire protection
requirements, other than those required in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the
inspector should ask the operator at the facility for a copy of the new requirements and
determine whether the CIWMB has been notified of the changes. The CIWMB should be
contacted after the inspection to verify any changes, as well as to confirm concurrence
with those changes.</p>

<p>Note any ponding of storm water in low spots in and around waste tire piles, as well as
obvious erosion channels conducting storm water toward a waste tire pile.</p>

<p>When contacting the local fire authority prior to inspecting the facility, the fire
protection safety officer should be asked if the facility grade poses a problem for
firefighting personnel and equipment. If so, the inspector should determine if any
mitigation measures for overcoming problems associated with the facility grade have been
approved by the local fire authority.</p>

<p>If the site is already fenced to meet the security requirements of §17352 the
requirements of subsection (f)(1) of this standard are probably being met. If the site is
unfenced and there is a possibility that it lies in a 100-year floodplain, the county
flood control agency or planning department should be contacted. This can be determined by
reviewing the particular Federal Emergency Management Act (FEMA) flood map at the local
flood control agency or planning department office. FEMA flood maps are also available at
the Sacramento branch library of the California Division of Mines and Geology.</p>

<p>If the facility is unpermitted the local fire authority should be contacted to
determine if the physical features of the site would interfere with firefighting equipment
or personnel.</p>

<p>If the facility is located near a body of water, such as a lake, river, pond, or creek,
the inspector should identify drainage structures around the pile(s) that would channel
pyrolytic oils resulting from a tire fire into a collection basin rather than the body of
water. Containment structures may need to be approved by the RWQCB, local fire authority,
or local flood control agency. These agencies should be contacted during the preinspection
workup.</p>

<p>A facility has violated this standard if: 

<ol>
  <li>Any of the tire stockpiles exceed any one of the maximum dimensions for a pile allowed
    under this regulation or under an alternative standard approved by the local fire
    authority and concurred with by the CIWMB.</li>
  <li>The facility stores tires over brush or within 40 feet of any flammable material or
    there is flammable material in the fire lanes.</li>
  <li>The operator did not notify the board of changes in storage and handling practices
    mandated by the local fire authority.</li>
  <li>Erosion channels are observed to be conducting storm water toward a tire stockpile, or
    ponding is observed around a stockpile. If evidence of prior ponding or stormwater
    channeling toward a stockpile is observed but no ponding or channeling is occurring at the
    time of the inspection, then an area of concern should be noted.</li>

<p>14 CCR §17355 Storage and Disposal of Waste Tires at Solid Waste Facilities</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) After January 1, 1993, waste tires may not be landfilled in a solid waste disposal
  facility which is permitted pursuant to Chapter 3 of Part 4 of the Public Resources Code,
  commencing with section 44001, unless they are permanently reduced in volume prior to
  disposal by shredding, or other methods subject to EA approval and Board approval.</p>
  <p>(b) The requirement of subsection (a) shall not apply to:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) waste tires received which are commingled with municipal solid waste that arrive in
    loads, where the waste tires comprise less than one-half of one (0.5) percent by weight of
    the total load, or where the waste tires inadvertently arrive in homeowner delivered
    household loads of mixed waste and are not readily removable from the waste stream; or</p>
    <p>(2) oversized waste tires, 17.5 x 24 or larger in size, received prior to January 1,
    1994.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(c) With the exception of waste tires that are stored in accordance with section
  17356(b), all waste tires stored at a solid waste facility shall meet the requirements of
  this Article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This standard applies to monthly EA inspections or during CIWMB inspections of MSWLFs
that store tires. Look for any stockpiles of 500 or more waste tires at the solid waste
facility. (<i><strong>Note:</strong></i> Do not count waste tires that are stored in enclosed
structures or trailers if the operator is complying with section 17356&#150;Indoor
Storage.) If the operator is storing 500 or more waste tires the stockpiles should be
stored in accordance with the requirements previously discussed.</p>

<p>Note whether the number of waste tires arriving in loads of MSW for landfilling exceeds
0.5 percent by weight of the total load. An example of this would be two waste tires
weighing 25 pounds each arriving in a transfer truck with a 10,000-pound payload.</p>

<p>During the inspection note any instance of whole tires not comingled with other wastes
being dumped at the working face and then buried with the rest of the wastes at the end of
the operating day. If the site routinely accepts waste tires for stockpiling at the
facility evaluate the pile(s) for compliance with the storage standards of §17354. If
tires are altered prior to landfilling make sure the means of altering them is approved by
the CIWMB and the enforcement agency. As of November 1993 the methods approved by the
CIWMB include shredding, quartering or slicing into four or more parts across the bead,
bagel splitting, baling, and manually cutting out the sidewalls including the bead to
produce three or more parts. The SWFP should reflect current waste tire operations at the
site. Document any discrepancies between the permit and what is actually being done with
respect to waste tires at the facility.</p>
<strong><i>

<p></i>14 CCR §17356 Indoor Storage</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Waste tires stored indoors must be stored under conditions that meet or exceed
  those in &quot;The Standard for Storage of Rubber Tires&quot;, National Fire Protection
  Association, NFPA 231D-1989 edition, published by the National Fire Protection Association
  which is incorporated by reference. This requirement shall apply unless the local fire
  authority having jurisdiction over a particular facility determines that a different
  requirement is necessary or adequate to meet the intent of these regulations for fire
  control and the protection of life and property. Any change in, or any new local fire
  authority requirements that affect the requirements in this Article shall be reported to
  the Board by the operator within 30 days after their effective date.</p>
  <p>(b) The storage requirements in this Article shall not apply to waste tires stored in
  fully enclosed moveable containers as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Containers shall be kept closed except while loading and unloading.</p>
    <p>(2) Containers shall be kept locked when not being loaded or unloaded unless the
    operator complies with section 17352 of this Article.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Indoor storage should include walls as well as a roof for housing the waste tires. The
regulations require that the building either meet the standards set in the National Fire
Protection Association (NFPA) 231D or meet other requirements established by the local
fire authority. The inspector should contact the local fire authority concerning
compliance with NFPA 231D or the local fire authority requirements. Compliance with NFPA
should be determined by the local fire authority because of the complexity of the
sprinkler specifications, etc.</p>

<p>If the tires are stored in fully enclosed movable containers all containers shall be
closed and locked when not being loaded or unloaded.</p>
