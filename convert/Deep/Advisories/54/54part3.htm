<h2><a name="PreinspectionProcedures">Preinspection Procedures</a></h2>

<p>During the preinspection workup the inspector should read and become familiar with all
sections of the most current valid solid waste facilities permit (SWFP), and either the
Report of Disposal Site Information (RDSI) or the newly required Joint Technical Document
(JTD), whichever type of document is referenced in the SWFP and governs operations of the
facility. If the facility is operating under a JTD the inspector should focus on those
sections identified in the JTD index as satisfying the requirements within the authority
of the LEA/CIWMB. For the remainder of this guidance document when a JTD is referred to it
means a JTD or RDSI, whichever document is governing that facility at the time. Before
conducting the inspection the information in these documents should be scrutinized for
consistency and then later be evaluated on site analyzing actual facility conditions and
operations. The inspector should then determine if the facility is in violation of any of
the applicable permit related statutes and/or regulations (PRC §§ 44002, 44004,
44014(b), and 27 CCR §§ 21630, 21640 and 21675).</p>

<p>LEA inspections should be coordinated in advance with other appropriate agencies when
issues or potential problems are involved that may require their input. The appropriate
agency should always be contacted concerning issues for which they have statutory or
regulatory authority. In some cases, it may be appropriate to contact several agencies
(e.g., RWQCB or the Air Pollution Control District) prior to the inspection.</p>

<h2><a name="InspectionProcedures">Inspection Procedures</a></h2>

<p>Inspections performed pursuant to PRC §43218 and 27 CCR should include, at a minimum,
a review of all standards included in 27 CCR, Division 2, Subdivision 1, CIWMB&#146;s
&quot;Consolidated Regulations for Treatment, Storage, Processing or Disposal of Solid
Waste.&quot; The inspection should also include a review of the facility's permit
conditions. Noncompliance with any applicable permit condition should be noted in the
inspection report. The review should include any local regulatory requirements for which
the LEA has enforcement authority, in addition to those of the state.</p>

<p>The time allotted for a field inspection depends upon the size and complexity of the
facility, as well as the frequency of inspection. The guidance presented in this document
is intended to cover a thorough inspection of any MSWLF. All inspection-related procedures
are listed so that the EA may have access to such information. It is understood that a
monthly inspection of a SWF by the EA may not require consideration of each and every item
presented here. However, the EA is responsible for verifying that the facility is either
in compliance or in violation of all applicable SMS each month. Inspections should always
be unannounced to the site operator, unless prevented by extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>
<a href="54part1.htm">Table of
    Contents</a><strong>

</strong>

</p>

<h3><a name="Arriving"><strong>Arriving at the Facility</strong></a></h3>

<p>In order to detect unpermitted operations and verify facility operating hours,
application of daily cover, and security precautions the inspector should arrive at the
facility before it opens in the morning. This is not possible at all facilities, i.e.,
those with continuous operations. In those cases, the inspector should evaluate the cover
standard at the time cover is required to be deposited in accordance with the JTD, RDSI or
SWFP.</p>

<h3><a name="GainingAccess">Gaining Access</a></h3>

<p>When entering a facility for the first time the inspector should drive first to the
gatehouse via the same entry point used by the public and/or contract waste haulers. At
the gatehouse the inspector should state the following: name, employer, reason for site
visit, and that photos may be taken as documentation. The employee at the gatehouse will
either tell the inspector to go on with the inspection or direct the inspector to speak
with an official at the facility.</p>

<p>If no employee is present at the gatehouse, or there is no gatehouse or scalehouse, the
inspector should attempt to find an employee at the site by going to the office area,
maintenance area, or the working face. Upon finding an employee the inspector should
follow the introduction above.</p>

<h3><a name="SitePersonnel">Meeting Site Personnel</a></h3>

<p>Early in the day the inspector should determine the best time to interview appropriate
site personnel and to inspect facility records. This will allow the inspector to arrange
for a supervisor or facility manager to be present to answer questions and to find or
provide access to records. It will also allow for arrangements to be made to get any
necessary keys to locked gas wells, arrange for observation of gas monitoring, etc. The
inspector should also notify the operator that an exit interview will be conducted at the
conclusion of the inspection. If the operator is unable to attend or send a representative
the inspector should make additional arrangements with the operator regarding the exit
interview or conduct the interview by telephone.</p>

</strong>

</p>

<h3><a name="DenialofAccess">Denial of Access</a></h3>

<p>If access is denied in any way the inspector should politely determine if the
individual denying access is the appropriate official to make such a decision. The
inspector should ask the reason for denial of access and verify that the purpose and
authority to conduct the inspection under the PRC are understood. If access is still
denied the inspector should abide by the operator's wishes, document the name of the
person denying access, and then call his/her supervisor. The supervisor, working with the
appropriate county, state, or Cal/EPA legal staff, should pursue the steps necessary to
gain access using an inspection warrant.</p>

<p>In addition to outright denial of entry, access denial may include preventing the
inspector from bringing in necessary equipment (camera), preventing access to documents,
or denying entry if the inspector refuses to sign a waiver or other legal document(s)
restricting the owner/operator's liabilities or obligations.</p>

<p>The reception of the inspector and the helpfulness of SWF officials will vary from site
to site. Most inspections can be accomplished without adversarial confrontations. However,
inspectors may be threatened by facility representatives during an inspection. If
threatened with violence the inspector should immediately stop the inspection, leave the
site or area where the threat exists, and contact his/her supervisor as soon as possible.
The name of the person who has threatened violence and nature of the threat should be
noted in the inspection report.</p>

<h3><font color="#000000"><a name="HSConsiderations">Health and Safety Considerations</a></font></h3>

<p>CIWMB staff recommends that each jurisdiction develop a health and safety plan for
conducting inspections of solid waste facilities. The plan should include equipment
requirements for field staff. For reference, the CIWMB's <i>Field Health and Safety Plan</i>
requires CIWMB inspectors to wear overalls, hard hat, safety vest, safety glasses, and
safety boots during an inspection. Ear protection and a dust mask should also be
immediately available in hand or in the inspector&#146;s vehicle (see Appendix A for
recommended health and safety equipment). An effective field health and safety program is
directly related to the dedication with which it is implemented by the inspectors.</p>

<p>The inspector should avoid areas of potential danger within, or adjacent to, the
facility such as unmarked internal roads that might be haul roads for heavy equipment,
steep slopes, and uneven ground that may also be unstable. In addition, the inspector
should be watching out for unfriendly fauna and flora including possible hazards such as
bees, wasps, spiders, snakes, bears, coyotes, feral animals, berry patches, and poison
oak.</p>

<p>

</strong>

</p>

<h3><a name="LandfillGas">Landfill Gas</a></h3>

<p>The CIWMB's <i>Field Health and Safety Plan</i> requires CIWMB inspectors to
continuously monitor for landfill gas (LFG) within the boundaries of the facility while
onsite using a combustible gas indicator (CGI). The inspector should avoid exposure to
landfill decomposition gas at or near gas collection and venting systems. The inspector
should always stay upwind of potential sources of LFG. Enclosed areas or confined spaces
including buildings, structures, or any low areas where gas may collect, such as sumps,
drains, tunnels, and structures housing gas collection systems, should not be entered
without first performing an air safety survey with a CGI.</p>

<p>Maintenance and equipment areas should be checked for LFG hazards within on-site
structures and for general safety problems. On-site structures and existing gas monitoring
probes or probe holes installed by the inspector should be monitored during the warmest
part of the day (usually 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.). This is because cooler temperatures (higher
atmospheric pressures) tend to suppress LFG migration. For comprehensive procedures
regarding LFG monitoring see LEA Advisory #44.</p>

<h3><a name="LandfillAreas">Landfill Areas</a></h3>

<p>A disposal site has three major areas covered by SMS. These areas include the working
face, site perimeter, and access road/gatehouse/office area. Other areas to be checked at
a disposal site include: 

<ul>
  <li>Recycling and/or salvaging areas (for illegal waste, fire or safety hazards, and
    excessive buildup of salvageable materials).</li>
  <li>The remainder of the landfill surface (for proper cover, grading, and unpermitted
    activities).</li>
  <li>Special waste areas (for proper handling procedures, fencing, and signing).<strong>
  </li>
</ul>
    </strong>
    <p>
<a href="54part1.htm">Table of
    Contents</a><strong>&nbsp; </p>

</strong>

<h3><a name="WorkingFace">Working Face</a></h3>

<p>Immediately after gaining access the inspector should drive to the working or
active face of the landfill. This will usually allow the inspector to witness the
condition of the working face from the previous day's operation and to learn if
unpermitted nighttime operations are taking place. If the site is still in darkness
inspectors should remain in their vehicle and travel only on the maintained access road to
the working face.</p>

<p>At the working face at least a dozen SMS can be evaluated, fully or partially, using
the SWIS inspection form for disposal sites. These minimum standards include the following
27 CCR Sections:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>20580&#151;Lighting<br />
    20590&#151;Personnel Health and Safety<br />
    20610&#151;Training<br />
    20615&#151;Supervision<br />
    20630&#151;Confined Unloading<br />
    20640&#151;Spreading and Compacting<br />
    20680&#151;Daily Cover<br />
    20710&#151;Scavenging, Salvage and Storage<br />
    20740&#151;Equipment<br />
    20780&#151;Burning Wastes<br />
    20810&#151;Vector and Bird Control<br />
    20870&#151;Hazardous Waste</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The working face, especially at a large landfill, should be observed several times
throughout the day of the inspection, and at least one of the observation periods should
be for 20-30 minutes. The inspector should use his/her safely parked vehicle or a safe
overlook as an observation location. In this way an inspector can observe, among other
things, equipment operations at the working face, traffic flow, waste screening,
scavenging, safety procedures, and adequacy of facility equipment.</p>

<p align="left">
<a href="54part1.htm">Table of
    Contents</a><strong>

</strong>

</p>

<h3><a name="SitePerimeter">Site Perimeter</a></h3>

<p>The inspector should walk and/or drive the entire perimeter of the disposal site
when possible. Conditions at the perimeter can vary daily and violations may also occur in
less visible areas. While at the facility perimeter the inspector can partially or fully
evaluate the following 27 CCR minimum standards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>20530&#151;Site Security<br />
    20760&#151;Nuisance Control<br />
    20790&#151;Leachate Control<br />
    20820&#151;Drainage and Erosion Control<br />
    20830&#151;Litter Control<br />
    20840&#151;Noise Control<br />
    20919&#151;Gas Control (monitor existing probes)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When possible, the inspector should check the lowest area of the perimeter where
leachate is most likely to leave the site and where most washout areas occur. Even in the
dry season, a prior ponding situation can be detected by looking for dried and cracked
silted areas.</p>

<p>The inspector should also go to the highest area of a disposal site to get an overall
view of the layout of the operation. This is also a good time and place to decide on how
to prioritize the inspection relative to the standards that are going to be evaluated.
This is a good place to draw a facility map or to note changes on a suitable existing
facility map.</p>

<p>
<a href="54part1.htm">Table of
    Contents</a><strong>

</strong>

</p>

<h3><a name="AccessRoad">Access Road/Gatehouse/Office Area</a></h3>

<p>At the access road/gatehouse/office area the inspector should evaluate traffic
flow, signs, sanitary facilities, records, communication facilities, and drinking and
washing facilities. This is also the area where the operator should conduct general or
visual load screening for hazardous materials.</p>

<h3><a name="Exit_Interview">Exit Interview</a></h3>

<p>At the beginning of the inspection the inspector should notify the operator that an
exit interview will be conducted at the conclusion of the inspection. The exit interview
is a summary of the inspection results, which allows the inspector to communicate
inspection findings to the operator. If the operator is unable to attend or send a
representative the inspector should contact the operator by telephone.</p>
