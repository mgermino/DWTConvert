<h2><a name="Stats/Regs">Statutes/Regulations Guidance</a></h2>

<p>Following are the applicable laws and regulations of the PRC and 27 CCR for solid waste
disposal sites. These are presented in the order as listed on the current SWIS inspection
form. The laws/regulations are bolded and italicized with guidance listed immediately
below. 14 CCR regulations regarding the disposal and storage of tires at solid waste
facilities are also included.</p>

<h3><a name="Permits">Permits</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>PRC §44002(a)(1) Operator Authorized by Solid Waste Facility Permit</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>No person shall operate a solid waste facility without a solid waste facilities permit
  if that facility is required to have a permit pursuant to this division. If the
  enforcement agency determines that a person is so operating a solid waste facility, the
  enforcement agency shall immediately issue a cease and desist order pursuant to Section
  45005 ordering the facility to immediately cease operations, and directing the owner or
  operator of the facility to obtain a solid waste facilities permit in order to resume
  operation of the facility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the current operator of a facility is found to be different from the operator listed
on the SWFP it is a violation of this section (see LEA #47 regarding information
concerning changes in owner and or operator). If the site has never been permitted and it
has been determined by the EA and/or the CIWMB that this site now needs a permit it is
also a violation of this section.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>PRC §44004 Significant Change</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) No operator of a solid waste facility shall make any significant change in the
  design or operation of the solid waste facility not authorized by the existing permit,
  unless the change is approved by the enforcement agency, and conforms with this division,
  and all regulations adopted pursuant to this division and the terms and conditions of the
  solid waste facilities permit are revised to reflect the change. </p>
  <p>(b) If the operator wishes to change the design or operation of the solid waste
  facility in a manner that is not authorized by the existing permit, the operator shall
  file an application for revision of the existing solid waste facilities permit with the
  enforcement agency. The application shall be filed at least 150 days in advance of the
  date when the proposed modification is to take place unless the 150-day time period is
  waived by the enforcement agency. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Violations under this section include tonnage increases, landfill elevation increases,
expansions of operations into property not within the current permitted boundary, new
operations (composting, energy recovery, etc.), and the acceptance of unpermitted wastes
such as ash, sewage sludge, and designated nonhazardous wastes that require special
handling.</p>

<p>If the EA has determined that the site has undergone a significant change in facility
conditions from those allowed by the SWFP and JTD a violation should be noted for PRC
§44004 and PRC §44014(b) - Permit Terms and Conditions. A significant change may prompt
further California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis, as well as a revision of the
SWFP. Note that CIWMB inspectors may make a determination of significant change only after
consultation with the LEA, the CIWMB&#146;s environmental review staff and his/her
supervisor before making a decision.</p>

<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table
of Contents</a></p>
<strong>

<p>PRC §44014(b) Permit Terms and Conditions</p>
</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>The permit shall contain all terms and conditions that the enforcement agency
  determines to be appropriate for the operation of the solid waste facility. The operator
  shall comply with all terms and conditions of the permit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the inspector finds that the operator is not complying with all terms and conditions
of the current valid SWFP, due to a significant change in operations, it is a violation of
this section. Items that may not constitute a significant change, such as a violation of
specific monitoring requirements of the SWFP, the inclusion of recycling operations, or
the receipt of special waste not described in the SWFP or JTD may constitute a violation
of this section.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §21640 Review of Permits</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Except as provided in §21680, all full SWFPs shall be reviewed and, if necessary,
  revised from the date of last issuance at least once every five years. </p>
  <p>(b) No less than 150 days before the permit is due for review, the operator shall
  submit an application for permit review. The application shall be made in the manner
  specified in section 21570 and 21590 and shall contain the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) identify the proposed changes in the design and operation; and</p>
    <p>(2) updated amendments to the Report of Facility Information (RFI);</p>
    <p>(3) for disposal sites only, the updated amendments shall include an estimate of the
    remaining site life and capacity.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Section 21640 requires that every permit must be reviewed every five years after its
issuance, most recent revision, or most recent review. Subsection (b) sets the time frame
for the operator to submit an application for the permit review. This section is violated
if the operator has not submitted an application for permit review at least 150 days prior
to the required review and the EA did not certify the review as complete by the due date.
EAs are also responsible to notify operators of impending permit review.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> This standard is not included on the SWIS form for disposal sites but is
a 27 CCR regulation that needs to be addressed satisfactorily by the operator and reviewed
by the EA.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §21590 Joint Technical Document for Disposal Facilities (JTD) </p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any operator of a disposal site which is required to submit a RDSI, closure/postclosure
  maintenance plan, and/or a ROWD or any other report that addresses similar regulatory
  concerns, may address those requirements under one JTD. The JTD will be used in place of
  the RDSI only if it meets all the requirements set forth in §21600 and lists where each
  requirement has been satisfied in the document in the form of a JTD index, pursuant to
  subsection (c).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The JTD replaces and combines the report of waste discharge and the CIWMB's RDSI. The
SWRCB/RWQCB and CIWMB/EA each provide a blank, agency-specific JTD index listing all
requirements the JTD must address for that agency. The discharger completes each agency's
index by filling in the JTD page(s) where each of that agency's requirements is addressed.
Coordinated review is assured by the fact that each JTD index line item includes an
indication as to whether interagency concern is likely. In this way, the reviewing person
(1) can quickly find the JTD page(s) addressing each given requirement, and (2) is
apprised of each topic where interagency coordination is required.</p>

<p>27 CCR §21665 requires that amendments to the JTD be filed with the EA, but it does
not require that they be concurred with by the CIWMB, unless the EA determines that a
permit revision is necessary. The CIWMB sections/index should not duplicate information
contained in the SWRCB sections/index.</p>

<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table
of Contents</a></p>

<h3><a name="RDSI">Report of Disposal Site Information</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §21600 Report of Disposal Site Information (RDSI)</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) In order to obtain a solid waste facility permit, each operator of a disposal site
  must file with the EA a RDSI as required in §21600 and §21590. The information contained
  in the RDSI shall be used to determine whether a permit should be issued and to provide
  information to be included within the permit if applicable. In order to maintain the
  permit, the operator must file amendments to the RDSI as required in §21665. Such
  amendments or lack thereof may become the basis for changes in the permit or for
  revocation of the permit. The submittal shall contain only those items listed in
  §21570(f) that have changed or otherwise specified by the enforcement agency. The RDSI is
  required to contain all the information listed in §21600(b)<i>.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspector should read and become familiar with the governing JTD (the governing JTD
is the one specifically referenced in the most current SWFP that has been concurred with
by the CIWMB) and any EA approved documents before going to a site. The inspector should
bring the working file with a copy of the JTD and EA approved amendments along on the
inspection. The governing JTD and any EA approved amendment(s) must reflect current site
operations as evaluated during the inspection. When applying §21600 the inspector should
record all discrepancies between the governing JTD (and any amendments) and actual design
and operations in his/her field notes. If the operator has instituted changes in design or
operation and no amendment has been submitted to the EA pursuant to §21665 it is a
violation of this standard. In addition, it may be a violation of PRC §44004 if the EA
deems the change(s) significant.</p>

<h3><a name="AirportSafety">Airport Safety</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20270 Location Restrictions: Airport Safety</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Owners or operators of new Municipal Solid Waste Landfill units (MSWLF), existing
  MSWLF units, and lateral expansions that are located within 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) of
  any airport runway and used by turbojet aircraft or within 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) of
  any airport runway end used by only piston-type aircraft must demonstrate that the units
  are designed and operated so that the MSWLF unit does not pose a bird hazard to aircraft.</p>
  <p>(b) Owners or operators proposing to site new MSWLF units and lateral expansions
  located within a five-mile radius of any airport runway end used by turbojet or
  piston-type aircraft must notify the affected airport and the Federal Aviation
  Administration (FAA).</p>
  <p>(c) The owner or operator must place the demonstration made pursuant to paragraph (a)
  of this section in the operating record and notify the EA that it has been placed in the
  operating record.</p>
  <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
  <p>Note: Subsection (d) has been changed and (e) has been added. The definitions are now
  in section 20164.</p>
  <p>(d) Existing MSWLF units that cannot make the demonstration specified in §20270(a)
  pertaining to airports must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>close by October 9, 1996 in accordance with §21110 of this article;</li>
  <li>conduct postclosure activities in accordance with §21110 of this article;</li>
</ol>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(3) conduct closure and postclosure activities in accordance with applicable sections
    of Chapter 4 and Chapter 6 of this division;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(e) The deadline for closure required by paragraph (a) of this section may be extended
  up to two years if the owner or operator demonstrates to the CIWMB that:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) There is no available alternative disposal capacity; and</p>
    <p>(2) There is no immediate threat to human health and the environment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspector needs to determine the following: Is there an airport nearby? Is it used
by piston or turbojet aircraft? How far is it from the landfill? If the criteria in
section (a) apply, the inspector should look for a record of demonstration in the
operating record. It is a violation of this section if no documentation exists, or if no
demonstration has been conducted.</p>

<p>A determination of the adequacy of this demonstration is not necessary but may be
appropriate if the inspector believes a bird hazard exists. The demonstration should
address at least the following: 

<ol>
  <li>Is the airport facility within the regulated distance?</li>
  <li>Is the runway part of a public-use airport?</li>
  <li>Does/will the existence of the MSWLF increase the likelihood of bird/aircraft that may
    cause damage to the aircraft or injury to its occupants?</li>
</ol>

<p>If a demonstration has been done and is in the operating record, yet the inspector
believes there may be a bird hazard to aircraft, the local airport and FAA should be sent
a copy of the demonstration project along with the inspector's written concerns. In this
case, an area of concern should be noted on the inspection report. The inspector should
verify that those MSWLFs that cannot make the demonstration have been allowed an extension
of closure/postclosure activities by the CIWMB.</p>

<h3><a name="Records">Records</a></h3>
<strong>
<i>

<p></i>27 CCR §20510 Disposal Site Operating Records</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Each site operator shall maintain records of weights or volumes accepted in a form
  and manner approved by the EA. Such records shall be submitted to the EA upon request, be
  accurate to within 10 percent and adequate for overall planning purposes and forecasting
  the rate of site filling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a site has scales the accuracy of records is easily calculated since records are
maintained by weight (i.e., tare vs. total weight). Tare is defined as the weight of a
vehicle deducted from the total weight (vehicle and load); the remainder is the weight of
the load. At sites without scales, where cubic yardage is converted to tonnage, the
operator should provide a description of the procedure used to calculate yardage. The
operator must also supply a conversion factor or conversion procedure for volume to
weight. The following minimum conversion factors may be used: 

<ul>
  <li>220 lbs/yd<sup>3</sup> for private vehicle waste loads</li>
  <li>500 lbs/yd<sup>3</sup> for compacted residential waste</li>
  <li>1600 lbs/yd<sup>3</sup> for sewage sludge</li>
</ul>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> The figures for municipal waste above are from <i>Managing Sanitary
Landfill Operations</i>, May 1989, Government Refuse Collection and Disposal Association.
The figure for sludge is from <i>Conversion Factors for Individual Material Types</i> by
the Tellus Institute (Appendix C).</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>(b) Each site operator shall maintain records of excavations which may affect
  the safe and proper operation of the site or cause damage to adjoining properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The records of cuts or excavations will usually be in the form of an annotation on a
site topographical map. This information may also be found in the JTD or Waste Discharge
Requirements (WDR). The RWQCB requires complete records regarding fill areas. The operator
should not be required to duplicate this information.</p>

<p>The inspector should note a violation if the operator is not recording excavations that
may affect adjoining properties. An area of concern should be indicated if records are not
available for cuts that were made in the recent past, as determined by the inspector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>(c) Each site operator shall maintain a daily log book or file of the
  following information: fires, landslides, earthquake damage, unusual and sudden
  settlement, injury and property damage accidents, explosions, receipt or rejection of
  unpermitted wastes, flooding, and other unusual occurrences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is recommended that this record be maintained as a single entity at one location,
for example, in a bound logbook, a file cabinet, or stored electronically as a clearly
identified computer file. The log should serve as a record of these situations, and as an
indicator of recurrent hazards or trends that can affect operation. Daily entries are
encouraged in order to discover patterns early and to develop a regular routine of entry.
If there are no special occurrences on a given day it is recommended that &quot;No special
occurrences&quot; or a similar entry be made in the log.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>(</i>d) Each site operator shall maintain a record of personnel training as
  required in §20610.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Staff training in hazardous waste recognition, heavy equipment operation, safety
practices, and emergency procedures should also be in the operating record.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>(e) Each site operator shall maintain a copy of written notification to the
  EA, local health agency, and fire authority of names, addresses and telephone numbers of
  the operator or responsible party of the site as required in §20615.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These notifications should be placed in the operating record.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>(f) Disposal Site Records, including MSWLF unit records, shall be available
  for inspection by authorized representatives of the EA, the local health entity and the
  CIWMB during normal business hours and retained near the site in an operating record or in
  an alternative location approved by the EA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Records not available on site should not be in an unreasonable or excessively distant
location. If some records are kept at a location other than the facility, the inspector
should travel to view the records on the day of the inspection or, if not possible,
request that the operator send copies of the records to the inspector within two weeks of
the inspection. The inspector should work with the operator to establish form and content
of the operating record so that this information is readily retrievable.</p>

<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table

<strong>

<p>27 CCR §20515 MSWLF Unit Records</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The owner or operator of a MSWLF unit must record the following information as it
  becomes available:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Any location restriction demonstration required under §20270;</p>
    <p>(2) Inspection records, training procedures, and notification procedures required in
    §20870;</p>
    <p>(3) Gas monitoring results from monitoring and any remediation plans required by
    §20919 of this Subchapter;</p>
    <p>(4) Closure and postclosure maintenance plans as required by section §21780, notice of
    intent to close the unit as required in §21135, notice of certification of closure as
    required by §21880, deed notation as required by §21170, demonstration of release from
    postclosure maintenance required by §21180, and any monitoring, testing, or analytical
    data as required by 40 CFR § 258.61; and</p>
    <p>(5) Any cost estimates and financial assurance documentation required by §§22221,
    22226, 21820, and 21840.</p>
    <p>(6) Any information demonstrating compliance with the small community exemption
    required by 40 CFR §258.1(f)(2).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(b) The owner/operator must notify the EA when the documents from paragraph (a) of this
  section have been placed in or added to the operating record, unless an alternative
  frequency is approved as specified in paragraph (c) and all information contained in the
  operating record must be furnished upon request to the EA.</p>
  <p>(c) The EA can set alternative schedules for recordkeeping and notification
  requirements as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except for the
  notification requirements in §20270.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Confirm the location of the operating record prior to inspection. This regulation sets
several specific record keeping requirements; the inspector may find it helpful to list
those requirements on the inspection form and to check them off for compliance in order to
verify that all necessary records and documents are maintained.</p>

<p>The owner must notify the EA when any of the above information has been placed in the
operating record. These records are available to the public through the California Public
Records Act.</p>

<p>Requests for alternative notification schedules or location shall be made by written
request to the EA and approved in writing.</p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20517 Documentation of Enforcement Agency Approvals, Determinations and
Requirements (new)</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Approvals, determinations and other requirements the EA is authorized to make under
  this Subchapter shall be documented in writing to the operator and placed in the operating
  record by the operator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If an EA has made an approval or determination regarding any of the regulations listed
in the EA approval section (page 9) of this advisory the finding needs to be communicated
to the operator in writing. A copy of that approval, determination, or directive should be
kept by both the operator and the EA for future reference.</p>

  <p>(b) If the site is open to the public, there shall be an easily visible sign at the
  primary entrance of the site a sign indicating the name of the site operator, the
  operator's telephone number, and, hours of operation; an easily visible sign at an
  appropriate point shall indicate the schedule of charges and the general types of
  materials which either (1) WILL be accepted or (2) WILL NOT be accepted.</p>
  <p>(c) If the site is open to the public, there shall be easily visible road signs and/or
  traffic control measures which direct traffic to the active face and other areas where
  wastes or recyclable materials will be deposited.</p>
  <p>(d) Additional signs and/or measures may be required at a disposal site by the EA to
  protect personnel and public health and safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signs are inadequate if the inspector or the public has difficulty finding the
operating area. Encourage the operator to include other applicable data such as the
contract operator&#146;s name (if any), telephone number, and the words &quot;disposal
site&quot; on the entry sign. This information provides identification for emergency
vehicles and the public. The data on these signs should be checked for consistency with
the data in the SWFP and JTD.</p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20530 Site Security</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>The site shall be designed to discourage unauthorized entry by persons or vehicles by
  using a perimeter barrier or topographic constraints. Areas within the site where open
  storage or ponding of hazardous materials occurs shall be separately fenced and or
  otherwise secured as determined by the EA. The EA may also require that other areas of the
  site be fenced to create an appropriate level of security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gates should be locked after operating hours. Damaged fencing should be repaired.
Separate fencing and warning signs are strongly recommended for areas designated for
septage or sewage sludge. If sites are open continuously (24 hours), site attendants
should keep gates and ponds under surveillance. The inspector should look for signs of
illegal entry such as tire tracks that enter the facility at the site perimeter.</p>
