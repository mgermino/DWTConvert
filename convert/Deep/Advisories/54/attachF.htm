    <strong>

<p>§66261.2. Definition of Waste.</strong></p>

<p>(a) &quot;Waste&quot; means any discarded material of any form (for example, liquid,
semi-solid, solid or gaseous) that is not excluded by section 66261.4(a) or section
66261.4(e) or that is not excluded by Health and Safety Code section 25143.2(b) or Health
and Safety Code section 25143.2(d).</p>

<p>(b) A discarded material is any material which is any of the following:</p>

<p>(1) relinquished as explained in subsection (c) of this section; or</p>

<p>(2) recycled, as explained in subsection (d) of this section; or</p>

<p>(3) considered inherently waste-like, as explained in paragraph (e) of this section.</p>

<p>(c) A material is a waste if it is relinquished by being any of the following:</p>

<p>(1) disposed of;</p>

<p>(2) burned or incinerated;</p>

<p>(3) accumulated, stored or treated, but not recycled, before or in lieu of, being
relinquished by being disposed of, burned or incinerated.</p>

<p>(d) A material is a waste if it is recycled, or accumulated, stored or treated before
recycling, by being managed:</p>

<p>(1) through being used in a manner constituting disposal:</p>

<p>(A) materials noted with an &quot;*&quot; in column 1 of Table I are wastes when they
are:</p>

<p>1. applied to or placed on the land in a manner that constitutes disposal; or</p>

<p>2. used to produce products that are applied to or placed on the land or are otherwise
contained in products that are applied to or placed on the land (in which cases the
product itself is a waste);</p>

<p>(B) however, commercial chemical materials listed in section 66261.33, which are
discarded commercial chemical products, off-specification species, container residues, or
spill residues thereof, and which are applied to the land and application to the land is
their ordinary manner of use are non-RCRA hazardous wastes. Commercial chemical products
which are &quot;retrograde materials&quot; as defined in section 66260.10 are not wastes
until they become &quot;recyclable materials&quot; pursuant to subsection (e) of the
definition of &quot;recyclable materials&quot; in section 66260.10;</p>

<p>(2) through being burned for energy recovery:</p>

<p>(A) materials noted with an &quot;*&quot; in column 2 of Table 1 are wastes when they
are:</p>

<p>1. burned to recover energy;</p>

<p>2. used to produce a fuel or are otherwise contained in fuels (in which cases the fuel
itself is a waste);</p>

<p>(B) however, commercial chemical materials listed in section 66261.33, which are
discarded commercial chemical products, off-specification species, container residues, or
spill residues thereof, and which are fuels are non-RCRA hazardous wastes. Commercial
chemical products which are &quot;retrograde materials&quot; as defined in section
66260.10 are not wastes until they become &quot;recyclable materials&quot; pursuant to
subsection (e) of the definition of &quot;recyclable materials&quot; in section 66260.10 </p>

<p>(3) through being reclaimed: materials noted with an &quot;*&quot; or &quot;**&quot; in
column 3 of Table 1 are wastes when reclaimed;</p>

<p>(4) through being accumulated speculatively: materials noted with an &quot;*&quot; or
&quot;**&quot; in column 4 of Table 1 are wastes when accumulated speculatively.</p>

<strong>

<p>Note</strong>: The terms &quot;spent materials,&quot; &quot;sludges,&quot; and
&quot;by-products&quot; are defined in section 66260.10.</p>

<p>*Except as provided in sections 66261.2(d)(1)(B) and 66261.2(d)(2)(B), a material
designated by a single asterisk in Column (1), (2), (3), or (4) is a waste which is not
eligible to be classified as a non-RCRA hazardous waste.</p>

<p>**Unless exempt pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 25143.2(d), a material
designated with a double asterisk in Column (3) or (4) which is identified as a hazardous
waste pursuant to section 66261.3 is a non-RCRA hazardous waste. Commercial chemical
products which are &quot;retrograde materials&quot; as defined in section 66260.10 are not
wastes until they become &quot;recyclable materials&quot; pursuant to subsection (e) of
the definition of &quot;recyclable materials&quot; in section 66260.10.</p>

<p>(e) A material is a waste if it is inherently waste-like when it is recycled. The
following materials are wastes when they are recycled: </p>

<p>(1) Hazardous Waste Nos. F020, F021 (unless used as an ingredient to make a product at
the site of generation), F022, F023, F026 and F028.</p>

<p>(2) Secondary materials fed to a halogen acid furnace that exhibit a characteristic of
a hazardous waste or are listed as a hazardous waste as defined in articles 3 or 4 of this
chapter, except for brominated material that meets the following criteria:</p>

<p>(A) The material must contain a bromine concentration of at least 45%; and</p>

<p>(B) The material must contain less than a total of 1% of toxic organic compounds listed
in appendix VIII; and</p>

<p>(C) The material is processed continually on-site in the halogen acid furnace via
direct conveyance (hard piping).</p>

<p>(f) A material is a waste if it poses a threat to human health or the environment and
meets either, or both, of the following:</p>

<p>(1) it is mislabeled or not adequately labeled, unless the material is correctly
labeled or adequately labeled within 10 days after the material is discovered to be
mislabeled or inadequately labeled;</p>

<p>(2) it is packaged in deteriorated or damaged containers, unless the material is
contained in sound or undamaged containers within 96 hours after the containers are
discovered to be deteriorated or damaged.</p>

<p>(g) Respondents in actions to enforce regulations implementing this division who claim
that a certain material is not a waste or is conditionally exempt from regulation, must
demonstrate that there is a known market or disposition for the material, and that they
meet the terms of the exclusion or exemption. In doing so, they must provide appropriate
documentation (such as contracts showing that a second person uses the material as an
ingredient in a production process) to demonstrate that the material is not a waste, or is
exempt from regulation. In addition, owners and operators of facilities claiming that they
are recycling materials must show that they have the necessary equipment to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>

<p>§66261.3. Definition of Hazardous Waste.</strong></p>

<p>(a) A waste, as defined in section 66261.2, is a hazardous waste if:</p>

<p>(1) it is not excluded from classification as a waste or a hazardous waste under Health
and Safety Code section 25143.2(b) or 25143.2(d) or section 66261.4; and</p>

<p>(2) it meets any of the following criteria:</p>

<p>(A) it exhibits any of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in article 3
of this chapter;</p>

<p>(B) it is listed in article 4 of this chapter and has not been excluded by the USEPA
Administrator from 40 CFR Part 261 Subpart D pursuant to 40 CFR sections 260.20 and
260.22;</p>

<p>(C) it is listed in or contains a constituent listed in Appendix X to this chapter.
However, the waste is not a hazardous waste if:</p>

<p>1. it is determined that the waste does not meet the criteria of subsection (a)(2)(B)
of this section; and</p>

<p>2. it is determined that the waste does not meet the criteria of subsection (a)(2)(A)
of this section by:</p>

<p>i. testing the waste according to the methods set forth in article 3 of this chapter,
or according to an equivalent method approved by the Department pursuant to section
66260.21; or</p>

<p>ii. applying knowledge of the hazardous properties of the waste in light of the
materials or the processes used and the characteristics set forth in article 3 of this
chapter;</p>

<p>(D) it is a mixture of a hazardous waste that is listed in article 4 of this chapter
other than a hazardous waste listed with hazard code (T) or (H), and another waste, unless
the resultant mixture no longer exhibits any characteristic of hazardous waste identified
in article 3 of this chapter. However, nonwastewater mixtures are still subject to the
requirements of chapter 18 of this division, even if they no longer exhibit a
characteristic at the point of land disposal;</p>

<p>(E) it is a mixture of a waste and one or more hazardous wastes listed in article 4 of
this chapter which has not been excluded by the USEPA Administrator from 40 CFR Part 261
Subpart D pursuant to 40 CFR sections 260.20 and 260.22. However,the following mixtures of
wastes and hazardous wastes listed in article 4 of this chapter are not hazardous wastes
(except by application of subsection (a)(2)(A) or (a)(2)(B) of this section) if the
generator can demonstrate that the mixture consists of wastewater, the discharge of which
is subject to regulation under either section 402 or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act
(including wastewater at facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater),
and:</p>

<p>1. one or more of the following spent solvents listed in section 66261.31--carbon
tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, trichoroethylene--provided, that the maximum total
weekly usage of these solvents (other than the amounts that can be demonstrated not to be
discharged to wastewater) divided by the average weekly flow of wastewater into the
headworks of the facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment system does not exceed 1
part per million; or</p>

<p>2. one or more of the following spent solvents listed in section 66261.31--methylene
chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, cresols, cresylic acid,
nitrobenzene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, carbon disulfide, isobutanol, pyridine, spent
chlorofluorocarbon solvents--provided that the maximum total weekly usage of these
solvents (other than the amounts that can be demonstrated not to be discharged to
wastewater) divided by the average weekly flow of wastewater into the headworks of the
facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment system does not exceed 25 parts per
million; or</p>

<p>3. heat exchanger bundle cleaning sludge from the petroleum refining industry (EPA
Hazardous Waste No. K050); or</p>

<p>4. a discarded commercial chemical product, or chemical intermediate listed in section
66261.33 arising from &quot;de minimis&quot; losses of these materials from manufacturing
operations in which these materials are used as raw materials or are produced in the
manufacturing process. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;de minimis&quot; losses
include those from normal material handling operations (e.g., spills from the unloading or
transfer of materials from bins or other containers, leaks from pipes, valves or other
devices used to transfer materials); minor leaks of process equipment, storage tanks or
containers; leaks from well-maintained pump packings and seals; sample purgings; relief
device discharges; discharges from safety showers and rinsing and cleaning of personal
safety equipment; and rinsate from empty containers or from containers that are rendered
empty by that rinsing; or</p>

<p>5. wastewater resulting from laboratory operations containing toxic (T) wastes listed
in article 4 of this chapter, provided that the annualized average flow of laboratory
wastewater does not exceed one percent of total wastewater flow into the headworks of the
facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment system, or provided the wastes, combined
annualized average concentration does not exceed one part per million in the headworks of
facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment facility. Toxic (T) wastes used in
laboratories that are demonstrated not to be discharged to wastewater are not to be
included in this calculation;</p>

<p>(F) it is not classified as a hazardous waste by application of the criteria in
subsections (a)(2)(A) through (a)(2)(E) of this section, but has been classified as a
hazardous waste by the Department because it otherwise conforms to the definition of
hazardous waste set forth in Health and Safety Code section 25117.</p>

<p>(b) A waste which is not excluded from classification as a waste or hazardous waste
under the provisions of section 66261.4(b) or Health and Safety Code section 25143.2(b) or
25143.2(d) becomes a hazardous waste when any of the following events occur:</p>

<p>(1) in the case of a waste listed in article 4 of this chapter, when the waste first
meets the listing description set forth in article 4 of this chapter;</p>

<p>(2) in the case of a mixture of waste and one or more hazardous wastes listed in
article 4 of this chapter, when the hazardous waste listed in article 4 of this chapter is
first added to the waste.</p>

<p>(3) In the case of any other waste (including a waste mixture), when the waste exhibits
any of the characteristics identified in article 3 of this chapter. </p>

<p>(c)(1) A hazardous waste will remain a hazardous waste unless and until it meets the
criteria of subsection (d) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
(c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, any waste generated from the treatment, storage, or
disposal of a hazardous waste, including any sludge, spill residue, ash, emission control
dust or leachate including precipitation run-off is a hazardous waste. (However, materials
that are reclaimed from wastes and that are used beneficially are not wastes and hence are
not hazardous wastes under this provision unless the reclaimed material is burned for
energy recovery or used in a manner constituting disposal.)</p>

<p>(2) Waste pickle liquor sludge generated by lime stabilization of spent pickle liquor
from the iron and steel industry (SIC Codes 331 and 332) is not hazardous even though it
is generated from the treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste, unless it
exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste.</p>

<p>(3)(A) Nonwastewater residues, such as slag, resulting from high temperature metals
recovery (HTMR) processing of K061, K062 or F006 waste, in units identified as rotary
kilns, flame reactors, electric furnaces, plasma arc furnaces, slag reactors, rotary
hearth furnace/electric furnace combinations or industrial furnaces (as defined in section
66260.10, for &quot;Industrial furnace&quot;, (f), (g), and (l)), that are disposed in
RCRA Subtitle D units, provided that these residues meet the generic exclusion levels
identified below for all constituents, and exhibit no characteristics of hazardous waste,
as identified in article 3 of Chapter 11 of division 4.5, Title 22, CCR. Testing
requirements shall be incorporated in a facility&#146;s waste analysis plan; at a minimum,
composite samples of residues shall be collected and analyzed quarterly and/or when the
process or operation generating the waste changes. Persons claiming this exclusion in an
enforcement action will have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
the material meets all of the exclusion requirements. </p>

<p>(B) A one-time notification and certification shall be placed in the facility&#146;s
files and sent to the Department for K061, K062 or F006 HTMR residues that meet the
generic exclusion levels for all constituents and do not exhibit any characteristics in
article 3 of chapter 11 that are sent to a RCRA subtitle D unit. The notification and
certification that is placed in the generators or treaters files shall be updated if the
process or operation generating the waste changes and/or if the 40 CFR subtitle D unit
receiving the waste changes. However, the generator or treater need only notify the
Department on an annual basis if such changes occur. Such notification and certification
should be sent to the Department by the end of the calendar year, but no later than
December 31.</p>

<p>The notification shall include the following information: (1) The name and address of
the RCRA Subtitle D unit receiving the waste shipments; (2) the EPA hazardous waste
number(s) and treatability group(s) at the initial point of generation; and (3) the
treatment standards applicable to the waste at the initial point of generation. The
certification shall be signed by an authorized representative and shall state as follows:
&quot;I certify under penalty of law that the generic exclusion levels for all
constituents have been met without impermissible dilution and that no characteristic of
hazardous waste, as identified in article 3 of chapter 11 of division 4.5, Title 22, CCR,
is exhibited. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false
certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.&quot;</p>

<p>(d) Any waste described in subsection (c) of this section is not a hazardous waste if
it meets both of the following criteria:</p>

<p>(1) the waste does not exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified
in article 3 of this chapter; (however, wastes that exhibit a characteristic at the point
of generation may still be subject to the requirements of chapter 18, even if they no
longer exhibit a characteristic at the point of land disposal,) and</p>

<p>(2) in the case of a waste which is a waste listed in article 4 of this chapter,
contains a waste listed under article 4 of this chapter or is derived from a waste listed
in article 4 of this chapter (but not including precipitation run off), the waste also has
been excluded by the USEPA Administrator from the lists of hazardous wastes in 40 CFR Part
261 Subpart D pursuant to 40 CFR sections 260.20 and 260.22.</p>

<p>(e) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c) of this section and provided the debris
as defined in section 66260.10 of chapter 10 of this division does not exhibit a
characteristic identified in article 3 of chapter 11 , the following materials are not
subject to regulation under chapters 10, 11 to 16, 18 or 20 of this division;</p>

<p>(1) Hazardous debris as defined in section 66260.10 of chapter 10 of this division that
has been treated using one of the required extraction or destruction technologies
specified in Table 1 of section 66268.45; persons claiming this exclusion in an
enforcement action will have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
the material meets all of the exclusion requirements; or</p>

<p>(2) Debris as defined in 66260.10 of chapter 10 of this division that the Department
considering the extent of contamination, has determined is no longer contaminated with
hazardous waste.</p>
