<h2>Title 22, California Code of Regulations</h2>

    <strong>

<p>§66262.34. Accumulation Time.</strong></p>

<p>(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, a generator may
accumulate hazardous waste on-site for 90 days or less without a permit or grant of
interim status, provided that:</p>

<p>(1)(A) the waste is placed in containers and the generator complies with article 9 of
chapter 15 of this division, or the waste is placed in tanks and the generator complies
with article 10 of chapter 15 of this division, except sections 66265.197(c) and
66265.200. In addition, such a generator is exempt from all the requirements in articles 7
and 8 of chapter 15 of this division, except for sections 66265.111 and 66265.114; or</p>

<p>(B) the waste is placed on drip pads and the generator complies with chapter 15,
article 17.5, and maintains the following records at the facility:</p>

<p>1. a description of procedures that will be followed to ensure that all wastes are
removed from the drip pad and associated collection system at least once every 90 days;
and</p>

<p>2. documentation of each waste removal, including the quantity of waste removed from
the drip pad and the sump or collection system and the date and time of removal; and/or</p>

<p>(C) the waste is placed in containment buildings and the generator complies with
article 20 of Chapter 15 of this division, has placed its professional engineer (PE)
certification that the building complies with the design standards specified in 66265.1101
in the facility&#146;s operating record no later than 60 days after the date of initial
operation of the unit. After February 18, 1993 , PE certification will be required prior
to operation of the unit. The owner or operator shall maintain the following records at
the facility:</p>

<p>1. a written description of procedures to ensure that each waste volume remains in the
unit for no more than 90 days, a written description of the waste generation and
management practices for the facility showing that they are consistent with respecting the
90 day limit, and documentation that the procedures are complied with; or</p>

<p>2. documentation that the unit is emptied at least once every 90 days; and</p>

<p>(2) the date upon which each period of accumulation begins is clearly marked and
visible for inspection on each container; and</p>

<p>(3) the generator complies with the requirements of subsection (f) of this section; and</p>

<p>(4) the generator complies with the requirements for owners or operators in articles 3
and 4 of chapter 15 of this division and with section 66265.16;</p>

<p>(b) The beginning of the 90 day period specified in subsections (a) and (c) of this
section is determined as follows:</p>

<p>(1) if the generator does not generate more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste or
one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste (listed in section 66261.33(e)) or one kilogram of
extremely hazardous waste during any calendar month, the 90 day period begins on the date
the generator has accumulated 100 kilograms of hazardous waste or one kilogram of acutely
hazardous waste or one kilogram of extremely hazardous waste;</p>

<p>(2) if the generator generates more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste or one
kilogram of acutely hazardous waste or one kilogram of extremely hazardous waste during
any calendar month, the 90-day period begins on the first date on which any amount of
hazardous waste begins to accumulate during that month.</p>

<p>(c) A generator who accumulates hazardous waste for more than 90 days is an operator of
a storage facility and is subject to the requirements of chapters 14 and 15 of this
division and the permit requirements of chapter 20 of this division, unless the generator
has been granted an extension to the 90-day period or meets the requirements of subsection
(d) or (e) of this section. An extension may be granted by the Department if hazardous
wastes must remain on-site for longer than 90 days due to unforeseen, temporary, and
uncontrollable circumstances. An extension of up to 30 days may be granted at the
discretion of the Department on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a generator of less than
1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste in any calendar month who accumulates hazardous waste
onsite for 180 days or less, or 270 days or less if the generator transports the
generator's own waste, or offers the generator's waste for transportation, over a distance
of 200 miles or more, for offsite treatment, storage, or disposal, is not a storage
facility if all of the following apply:</p>

<p>(1) The quantity of hazardous waste accumulated onsite never exceeds 6,000 kilograms.</p>

<p>(2) The generator complies with the requirements of subdivisions (d), (e) and (f) of
section 262.34 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>

<p>(3) The generator does not hold acutely hazardous waste or extremely hazardous waste in
an amount greater than one kilogram for more than 90 days.</p>

<p>(e)(1) A generator may accumulate as much as 55 gallons of hazardous waste, one quart
of acutely hazardous waste (listed in section 66261.33(e)) or one quart of extremely
hazardous waste at or near any point of generation, without a permit or grant of interim
status, without complying with subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, if all of the
following requirements are met with respect to this waste:</p>

<p>(A) the waste is accumulated in containers, other than tanks, at the initial
accumulation point which is at or near the area where the waste is generated and which is
under the control of the operator of the process generating the waste;</p>

<p>(B) the generator does not hold the waste onsite for more than one year from the
initial date of accumulation, or for longer than the applicable accumulation period
specified in subdivision (a) or (d), whichever occurs first. For purposes of this
subdivision, the applicable accumulation period specified in subdivision (a) or (d) shall
start on the date the quantity limitation specified in paragraph 1 of subsection (e) of
this section is reached;</p>

<p>(C) the initial date of waste accumulation is clearly marked and visible for inspection
on each container used for accumulation of hazardous waste;</p>

<p>(D) the generator complies with sections 66265.171, 66265.172, and 66265.173(a) of this
division; and</p>

<p>(E) the generator complies with subsections (e)(2), (e)(3) and (f)(3) of this section.</p>

<p>(2) Except as provided in subsections (e)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(B) of this section, a
process or group of processes meeting the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this
section, shall be subject to a single 55 gallon or one quart accumulation limit for that
process or group of processes.</p>

<p>(A) If not all of the wastestreams generated by a single process or group of processes
located within the same physical area are compatible, a separate 55 gallon or one quart
limit shall apply to each group of wastestreams that are compatible.</p>

<p>(B) If the generator determines that using only one 55-gallon or one-quart container to
initially accumulate specific compatible wastestreams is not practical (e.g., prevents
recycling or requires unreasonable accumulation procedures) or safe from an environmental
or worker/public health and safety standpoint, the generator may use a separate 55-gallon
or one-quart container for those specific compatible wastestreams. The generator's
determination shall be subject to review and approval by the Department at any time.</p>

<p>(3) A generator who has accumulated an amount of hazardous waste, acutely hazardous
waste or extremely hazardous waste equal to any applicable quantity limitation listed in
subsection (e)(1) of this section at or near any point of generation shall, with respect
to that waste, comply within three days with subsection (a) of this section and other
applicable provisions of this division. During the three day period the generator shall
continue to comply with subsection (e)(1) of this section. Within the three day period,
the generator shall mark the container holding the hazardous waste with the date the
applicable quantity limitation was reached.</p>

<p>(f) Generators who accumulate hazardous waste on site without a permit or grant of
interim status shall comply with the following requirements:</p>

<p>(1) the date upon which each period of accumulation begins shall be clearly marked and
visible for inspection on each container and portable tank;</p>

<p>(2) the date the applicable accumulation period specified in subsection (a) or (d) of
this section begins, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, shall be
clearly marked and visible for inspection on each container and tank; and</p>

<p>(3) each container and tank used for onsite accumulation of hazardous waste shall be
labeled or marked clearly with the words, &quot;Hazardous Waste.&quot; Additionally, all
containers and portable tanks shall be labeled with the following information:</p>

<p>(A) composition and physical state of the wastes;</p>

<p>(B) statement or statements which call attention to the particular hazardous properties
of the waste (e.g., flammable, reactive, etc.);</p>

<p>(C) name and address of the person producing the waste.<strong></p>

<p>§66265.193. Containment and Detection of Releases.</strong></p>

pressure.</p>

<p>(3) Double-walled tanks shall be:</p>

<p>(A) designed as an integral structure (i.e., an inner tank within an outer shell) so
that any release from the inner tank is contained by the outer shell;</p>

<p>(B) protected, if constructed of metal, from both corrosion of the primary tank
interior and the external surface of the outer shell; and</p>

<p>(C) provided with a built-in, continuous leak detection system capable of detecting a
release within 24 hours or at the earliest practicable time, if the owner or operator can
demonstrate to the Department, and the Department concurs, that the existing leak
detection technology or site conditions will not allow detection of a release within 24
hours.</p>

<p>(f) Ancillary equipment shall be provided with full secondary containment (e.g.,
trench, jacketing, double-walled piping) that meets the requirements of subsections (b)
and (c) of this section except for:</p>

<p>(1) aboveground piping (exclusive of flanges, joints, valves, and connections) that are
visually inspected for leaks on a daily basis;</p>

<p>(2) welded flanges, welded joints, and welded connections that are visually inspected
for leaks on a daily basis;</p>

<p>(3) sealless or magnetic coupling pumps and sealless valves, that are visually
inspected for leaks on a daily basis; and</p>

<p>(4) pressurized aboveground piping systems with automatic shut-off devices (e.g.,
excess flow check valves, flow metering shutdown devices, loss of pressure actuated
shut-off devices) that are visually inspected for leaks on a daily basis.</p>

<p>(g) The owner or operator may obtain a variance from the requirements of this section
for existing above-ground tanks in place, if the Department finds, as a result of a
demonstration by the owner or operator, either that alternative design and operating
practices, together with location characteristics, will prevent the migration of hazardous
waste or hazardous constituents into the ground water or surface water at least as
effectively as secondary containment during the active life of the tank system, or that in
the event of a release that does migrate to ground water or surface water, no substantial
present or potential hazard will be posed to human health or the environment.</p>

<p>(1) In deciding whether to grant a variance based on a demonstration of equivalent
protection of ground water and surface water, the Department will consider: </p>

<p>(A) the nature and quantity of the waste; </p>

<p>(B) the proposed alternate design and operation;</p>

<p>(C) the hydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the thickness of soils between
the tank system and ground water; and</p>

<p>(D) all other factors that would influence the quality and mobility of the hazardous
constituents and the potential for the constituents to migrate to ground water or surface
water.</p>

<p>(2) In deciding whether to grant a variance, based on a demonstration of no substantial
present or potential hazard, the Department will consider:</p>

<p>(A) the potential adverse effects on ground water, surface water, and land quality
taking into account:</p>

<p>1. the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the tank system, including
its potential for migration,</p>

<p>2. the hydrogeological characteristics of the facility and surrounding land,</p>

<p>3. the potential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents,</p>

<p>4. the potential for damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures
caused by exposure to waste constituents, and</p>

<p>5. the persistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects;</p>

<p>(B) the potential adverse effects of a release on ground-water quality, taking into
account:</p>

<p>1. the quantity and quality of ground water and the direction of ground-water flow,</p>

<p>2. the proximity and withdrawal rates of water in the area,</p>

<p>3. the current and future uses of ground water in the area, and</p>

<p>4. the existing quality of ground water, including other sources of contamination and
their cumulative impact on the ground-water quality;</p>

<p>(C) the potential adverse effects of a release on surface water quality, taking into
account:</p>

<p>1. the quantity and quality of ground water and the direction of ground-water flow,</p>

<p>2. the patterns of rainfall in the region,</p>

<p>3. the proximity of the tank system to surface waters,</p>

<p>4. the current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality
standards established for those surface waters, and</p>

<p>5. the existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and
the cumulative impact on surface-water quality; and</p>

<p>(D) the potential adverse effects of a release on the land surrounding the tank system,
taking into account:</p>

<p>1. the patterns of rainfall in the region, and</p>

<p>2. the current and future uses of the surrounding land.</p>

<p>(3) The owner or operator of a tank system, for which a variance from secondary
containment has been granted in accordance with the requirements of subsection (g)(l) of
this section, at which a release of hazardous waste has occurred from the primary tank
system but has not migrated beyond the zone of engineering control (as established in the
variance), shall:</p>

<p>(A) comply with the requirements of section 66265.196, except subsection (e); and</p>

<p>(B) decontaminate or remove contaminated soil to the extent necessary to:</p>

<p>1. enable the tank system, for which the variance was granted, to resume operation with
the capability for the detection of and response to releases at least equivalent to the
capability it had prior to the release, and</p>

<p>2. prevent the migration of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents to ground water
or surface water; and</p>

<p>(C) if contaminated soil cannot be removed or decontaminated in accordance with
subsection (g)(3)(B) of this section, comply with the requirements of section
66265.197(b);</p>

<p>(4) The owner or operator of a tank system, for which a variance from secondary
containment has been granted in accordance with the requirements of subsection (g)(l) of
this section, at which a release of hazardous waste has occurred from the primary tank
system and has migrated beyond the zone of engineering control (as established in the
variance), shall:</p>

<p>(A) comply with the requirements of section 66265.196(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e); and</p>

<p>(B) prevent the migration of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents to ground water
or surface water, if possible, and decontaminate or remove contaminated soil. If
contaminated soil cannot be decontaminated or removed, or if ground water has been
contaminated, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of section
66265.197(b);</p>

<p>(C) if repairing, replacing, or reinstalling the tank system, provide secondary
containment in accordance with the requirements of subsections (a) through (f) of this
section or reapply for a variance from secondary containment and meet the requirements for
new tank systems in section 66265.192 if the tank system is replaced. The owner or
operator shall comply with these requirements even if contaminated soil can be
decontaminated or removed, and ground water or surface water has not been contaminated.</p>

<p>(h) The following procedures shall be followed in order to request a variance from
secondary containment:</p>

<p>(1) The Department shall be notified in writing by the owner or operator that the
facility intends to conduct and submit a demonstration for a variance from secondary
containment as allowed in subsection (g) of this section at least 24 months prior to the
date that secondary containment is required to be provided in accordance with subsection
(a) of this section.</p>

<p>(2) As part of the notification, the owner or operator shall also submit to the
Department a description of the steps necessary to conduct the demonstration and a
timetable for completing each of the steps. The demonstration shall address each of the
factors listed in subsection (g)(l) or subsection (g)(2) of this section.</p>

<p>(3) The demonstration for a variance shall be completed and submitted to the Department
within 180 days after notifying the Department of intent to conduct the demonstration.</p>

<p>(4) The Department will inform the public, through a newspaper notice, of the
availability of the demonstration for a variance. The notice shall be placed in a daily or
weekly major local newspaper of general circulation and shall provide at least 30 days
from the date of the notice for the public to review and comment on the demonstration for
a variance. The Department also will hold a public hearing, in response to a request or at
the Department's own discretion, whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues
concerning the demonstration for a variance. Public notice of the hearing will be given at
least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing and may be given at the same time as notice
of the opportunity for the public to review and comment on the demonstration. These two
notices may be combined.</p>

<p>(5) The Department will approve or disapprove the request for a variance within 90 days
of receipt of the demonstration from the owner or operator and will notify in writing the
owner or operator and each person who submitted written comments or requested notice of
the variance decision. If the demonstration for a variance is incomplete or does not
include sufficient information, the 90-day time period will begin when the Department
receives a complete demonstration, including all information necessary to make a final
determination. If the public comment period in subsection (h)(4) of this section is
extended, the 90-day time period will be similarly extended.</p>

<p>(i) All tank systems, until such time as secondary containment meeting the requirements
of this section is provided, shall comply with the following:</p>

<p>(1) for non-enterable underground tanks, a leak test that meets the requirements of
section 66265.191(b)(5) shall be conducted at least annually;</p>

<p>(2) for other than non-enterable underground tanks and for all ancillary equipment, an
annual leak test, as described in paragraph (i)(l) of this section, or an internal
inspection or other tank integrity examination by an independent, qualified, professional
engineer, registered in California, that addresses cracks, leaks, corrosion, and erosion
shall be conducted at least annually. The owner or operator shall remove the stored waste
from the tank, if necessary, to allow the condition of all internal tank surfaces to be
assessed.</p>

<p>(3) The owner or operator shall maintain on file at the facility a record of the
results of the assessments conducted in accordance with subsections (i)(l) and (i)(2) of
this section.</p>

<p>(4) If a tank system or component is found to be leaking or unfit for use as a result
of the leak test or assessment in subsections (i)(l) and (i)(2) of this section, the owner
or operator shall comply with the requirements of section 66265.196.</p>

<p>(j)(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c) of this section, secondary
containment that meets the requirements of subsection (l) shall be provided for tank
systems used to manage hazardous wastes generated onsite, and which meet the criteria
specified in subsection (j)(2) of this section:</p>

<p>(A) prior to the tank system or component being placed in service for new tank systems
or components; or</p>

<p>(B) by January 24, 1998 for existing tank systems.</p>

<p>(2) The provisions of subsection (j)(1) of this section apply only to:</p>

<p>(A) onground or aboveground tank systems containing only non-RCRA hazardous wastes
generated onsite, and tank systems authorized under Permit-by-Rule pursuant to Chapter 45
of this division, Conditional Authorization pursuant to HSC 25200.3, and Conditional
Exemption pursuant to HSC 25201.5, and</p>

<p>(B) onground or aboveground tank systems containing RCRA hazardous wastes generated
onsite, if:</p>

<p>1. the owner or operator is a conditionally exempt small quantity generator as defined
in 40 CFR section 261.5, or a small quantity generator of more than 100 kg but less than
1000 kg per month as defined in 40 CFR section 265.201, or</p>

<p>2. the owner or operator is not subject to regulation in 40 CFR part 265 pursuant to an
exemption in 40 CFR section 265.1, but the owner or operator is subject to the standards
of this article.</p>

<p>(k) A generator or owner or operator authorized pursuant to Permit-by-Rule pursuant to
Chapter 45 of this division, Conditional Authorization pursuant to HSC 25200.3, or
Conditional Exemption pursuant to HSC 25201.5, operating a non-RCRA underground tank
system or an underground tank system otherwise exempt from permitting requirements
pursuant to the federal act, shall comply with the applicable standards of Title 23 of the
California Code of Regulations relating to underground tank systems.</p>

<p>(l) Secondary containment for onground or aboveground generator and onsite tier
(Permit-by Rule, Conditional Authorization, and Conditional Exemption), non-RCRA tank
systems or tank systems otherwise exempt from permitting requirements pursuant to the
federal act, shall consist of any of the devices listed in subsection (d) and satisfy the
requirements of (e) of this section or consist of any device or combination of devices as
approved in writing by the CUPA, or the Department if there is no CUPA or the CUPA
requests that the Department make a determination, which would satisfy the following
minimum requirements:</p>

<p>(1) designed, installed, and operated to prevent any migration of wastes or accumulated
liquid out of the system to the soil, ground water, surface water, or air at any time
during the use of the tank system; and</p>

<p>(2) capable of detecting and collecting releases and accumulated liquids until the
collected material is removed.</p>

<p>(m) Ancillary equipment shall be provided with secondary containment as specified in
subsection (f) of this section or an alternative device or devices as approved in writing
by the CUPA, or Department if there is no CUPA or the Department if the CUPA requests that
the Department make a determination, which would prevent and/or detect any release of
wastes out of the tank system before such wastes could migrate to the soil, ground water,
or surface water at any time during the use of the tank system. The following are examples
of tank system and ancillary equipment secondary containment alternatives or options that
may be proposed for review and approval by the CUPA:</p>

<p>(1) traditional containment of entire tank system within a bermed containment area with
visual and/or electronic leak detection monitoring;</p>

<p>(2) troughs or pipe runs with impermeable liners that incorporate the following:</p>

<p>(A) visual monitoring during hours of operation or;</p>

<p>(B) continuous electronic leak detection monitoring for releases or;</p>

<p>(C) sumps located at low elevations with leak detection monitors.</p>

<p>(3) double-walled piping with continuous interstitial monitoring or monitoring
intervals located at low elevation points along pipeline;</p>

<p>(4) Double-walled piping with translucent or transparent sections located at low points
or low endpoints so that visual monitoring is possible.</p>

<p>(n) A generator or owner or operator authorized pursuant to Permit-by-Rule pursuant to
Chapter 45 of this division, Conditional Authorization pursuant to HSC 25200.3, and
Conditional Exemption pursuant to HSC 25201.5, operating an onground or aboveground,
non-RCRA tank system or a tank system otherwise exempt from permitting requirements
pursuant to the federal act, that has 18 months or less remaining in service prior to
planned closure of the tank system, may propose alternatives to retrofitting the tank
system with secondary containment. Local agency requirements must be considered when
proposing alternatives to secondary containment. The owner or operator shall provide the
following information in writing to the CUPA, or the Department if there is no CUPA or the
CUPA requests that the Department make a determination, so that a determination can be
made whether the proposed alternative would be acceptable:</p>

<p>(1) name, address, and EPA identification number of the facility;</p>

<p>(2) date of planned closure;</p>

<p>(3) description of tank system to be closed and form of current authorization for the
tank system;</p>

<p>(4) description of how the proposed alternative would provide adequate environmental
protection such that the design, installation, and operation will be capable of detecting
a release and preventing any migration of wastes or accumulated liquid out of the system
to the soil, ground water, surface water, or air at any time during the remaining life of
the tank system.&nbsp;</p>
