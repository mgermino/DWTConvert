<h2>Title 22, California Code of Regulations</h2>

    <strong>

<p>§66266.130. Management of Used Oil Filters.</strong></p>

<p>(a) Used oil filters are to be managed as hazardous waste unless the conditions of one
of the following paragraphs are met:</p>

<p>(1) The filters are characterized as being nonhazardous using procedures identified in
this division and applicable waste characterization procedures found in federal
regulations or;</p>

<p>(2) The conditions of subsection (b) of this section are met and the filters are
managed in compliance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section or;</p>

<p>(3) The filters are generated by persons maintaining their own place of residence
(i.e., household waste) and such filters are taken to a collection location (such as a
service station, parts retailer, household waste collection location, etc.) or picked up
by a curbside collection system and transferred for purposes of recycling. The filters
must be contained after their initial acceptance or collection so as to capture used oil
that may separate from them. Upon reaching a location where proper drainage is practical,
the filters shall be managed in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p>(b) For the purposes of subsection (c) of this section, &quot;used oil filters&quot;
are defined as filters which contain a residue of used oil (as defined in Health and
Safety Code Section 25250.1(a)) and which are exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste
under the scrap metal provision found in federal law (40 CFR Section 261.6(a)(3)(iv)).</p>

<p>(c) In accordance with subsection (a) of this section, used oil filters that meet the
conditions of subsection (b) of this section and are managed and recycled in compliance
with the following requirements shall not be regulated as hazardous waste.</p>

<p>(1) The filters are drained of free-flowing used oil. For the purposes of this
subsection, free--flowing is defined as a continuous stream of oil exiting the filter when
the filter is inverted. Oil exiting drop by drop is not considered to be free-flowing.
However, if the filter is equipped with a device (such as a rubber flap located just
inside the filter opening) which impedes the drainage of used oil from the filter, that
device shall be manipulated to allow the oil to exit the filter freely, or the filter
punctured, crushed, opened, drained, or otherwise handled in a manner that will allow the
used oil to exit the filter.</p>

<p>(2) The drained used oil filters are transported for purposes of metal reclamation to
any of the following:</p>

<p>(A) A smelter or other scrap metal processor where they are recycled or;</p>

<p>(B) A storage facility or consolidation facility that subsequently transfers the
filters to a facility described in paragraph (A) or (C) of this subsection or;</p>

<p>(C) A municipal solid waste incinerator for energy recovery, if the residual casings
are subsequently transferred to a facility described in paragraph (A) of this subsection,
or to a storage or consolidation facility that subsequently transfers the residual casings
to a facility described in paragraph (A) of this subsection.</p>

<p>(3) The drained used oil filters are accumulated, stored, and transferred in a closed,
rainproof container that is capable of containing any used oil that may separate from the
filters placed inside. Drums of used oil filters shall be sealed during transfer so that
used oil will not spill out when they are laid upon their sides. Drums shall be secured as
a load to prevent movement or tipping during transfer. Containers shall be labeled as
&quot;drained used oil filters&quot; (not as hazardous waste) and show initial date of
accumulation or receipt on each container of filters.</p>

<p>(4) Storage of less than one ton of used oil filters shall be limited to one year.
Storage of one ton or more of used oil filters is limited to 180 days.</p>

<p>(5) Persons generating, transporting, or receiving used oil filters shall use a bill of
lading to record the transfer of used oil filters. Bills of lading must indicate
generator, transporter, and receiving company names, addresses, telephone numbers, the
quantity and size of used oil filter containers transferred, and the date of transfer. A
copy of each bill of lading must be kept on the premises of the generator, transporter,
and receiving facility where the used oil filters were handled. Copies of bills of lading
shall be kept for a period of three years.</p>

<p>(6) Used oil which incidentally accumulates in a container used to store and/or
transfer used oil filters shall not be subject to the requirements of Article 13, Chapter
6.5, Division 20, Health and Safety Code (HSC) until after the filters have been removed
from the container so long as applicable requirements of this section are met. Used oil
that is separated from the used oil filters during draining procedures, as required in
paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this section, shall be managed in accordance with
Article 13 (HSC).</p>

<p>(d) A person who treats a used oil filter which has been drained of free-flowing oil in
accordance with paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this section is authorized, for the
purposes of Health and Safety Code section 25201, to perform such activities if any used
oil or other residue generated in the course of conducting those activities is managed in
accordance with the requirements of this division.</p>
