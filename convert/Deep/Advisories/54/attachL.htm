<h2>Clean Air Act</h2>
<strong>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">§ 110. State implementation plans for national primary and secondary
ambient air quality standards</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Adoption of plan by State; submission to Administrator; content of
plan; revision; new sources; indirect source review program; supplemental or intermittent
control systems</p>

<p>(1) Each State shall, after reasonable notice and public hearings,
adopt and submit to the Administrator, within 3 years (or such shorter period as the
Administrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a national primary ambient air
quality standard (or any revision thereof) under section 7409 of this title for any air
pollutant, a plan which provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of such
primary standard in each air quality control region (or portion thereof) within such
State. In addition, such State shall adopt and submit to the Administrator (either as a
part of a plan submitted under the preceding sentence or separately) within 3 years (or
such shorter period as the Administrator may prescribe) after the promulgation of a
national ambient air quality secondary standard (or revision thereof), a plan which
provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of such secondary standard in
each air quality control region (or portion thereof) within such State. Unless a separate
public hearing is provided, each State shall consider its plan implementing such secondary
standard at the hearing required by the first sentence of this paragraph.</p>

<p>(2) Each implementation plan submitted by a State under this
chapter shall be adopted by the State after reasonable notice and public hearing. Each
such plan shall--</p>

<p>(A) include enforceable emission limitations and other control
measures, means, or techniques (including economic incentives such as fees, marketable
permits, and auctions of emissions rights), as well as schedules and timetables for
compliance, as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of this
chapter;</p>

<p>(B) provide for establishment and operation of appropriate devices,
methods, systems, and procedures necessary to--</p>

<p>(i) monitor, compile, and analyze data on ambient air quality,
and</p>

<p>(ii) upon request, make such data available to the Administrator;</p>

<p>(C) include a program to provide for the enforcement of the
measures described in subparagraph (A), and regulation of the modification and
construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to
assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved, including a permit
program as required in parts C and D of this subchapter;</p>

<p>(D) contain adequate provisions--</p>

<p>(i) prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter,
any source or other type of emissions activity within the State from emitting any air
pollutant in amounts which will--</p>

<p>(I) contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with
maintenance by, any other State with respect to any such national primary or secondary
ambient air quality standard, or</p>

<p>(II) interfere with measures required to be included in the
applicable implementation plan for any other State under part C of this subchapter to
prevent significant deterioration of air quality or to protect visibility,</p>

<p>(ii) insuring compliance with the applicable requirements of
sections 7426 and 7415 of this title (relating to interstate and international pollution
abatement);</p>

<p>(E) provide (i) necessary assurances that the State (or, except
where the Administrator deems inappropriate, the general purpose local government or
governments, or a regional agency designated by the State or general purpose local
governments for such purpose) will have adequate personnel, funding, and authority under
State (and, as appropriate, local) law to carry out such implementation plan (and is not
prohibited by any provision of Federal or State law from carrying out such implementation
plan or portion thereof), (ii) requirements that the State comply with the requirements
respecting State boards under section 7428 of this title, and (iii) necessary assurances
that, where the State has relied on a local or regional government, agency, or
instrumentality for the implementation of any plan provision, the State has responsibility
for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision;</p>

<p>(F) require, as may be prescribed by the Administrator--</p>

<p>(i) the installation, maintenance, and replacement of equipment,
and the implementation of other necessary steps, by owners or operators of stationary
sources to monitor emissions from such sources,</p>

<p>(ii) periodic reports on the nature and amounts of emissions and
emissions- related data from such sources, and</p>

<p>(iii) correlation of such reports by the State agency with any
emission limitations or standards established pursuant to this chapter, which reports
shall be available at reasonable times for public inspection;</p>

<p>(G) provide for authority comparable to that in section 7603 of
this title and adequate contingency plans to implement such authority;</p>

<p>(H) provide for revision of such plan--</p>

<p>(i) from time to time as may be necessary to take account of
revisions of such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard or the
availability of improved or more expeditious methods of attaining such standard, and</p>

<p>(ii) except as provided in paragraph (3)(C), whenever the
Administrator finds on the basis of information available to the Administrator that the
plan is substantially inadequate to attain the national ambient air quality standard which
it implements or to otherwise comply with any additional requirements established under
this chapter;</p>

<p>(I) in the case of a plan or plan revision for an area designated
as a nonattainment area, meet the applicable requirements of part D of this subchapter
(relating to nonattainment areas);</p>

<p>(J) meet the applicable requirements of section 7421 of this title
(relating to consultation), section 7427 of this title (relating to public notification),
and part C of this subchapter (relating to prevention of significant deterioration of air
quality and visibility protection);</p>

<p>(K) provide for--</p>

<p>(i) the performance of such air quality modeling as the
Administrator may prescribe for the purpose of predicting the effect on ambient air
quality of any emissions of any air pollutant for which the Administrator has established
a national ambient air quality standard, and</p>

<p>(ii) the submission, upon request, of data related to such air
quality modeling to the Administrator;</p>

<p>(L) require the owner or operator of each major stationary source
to pay to the permitting authority, as a condition of any permit required under this
chapter, a fee sufficient to cover--</p>

<p>(i) the reasonable costs of reviewing and acting upon any
application for such a permit, and</p>

<p>(ii) if the owner or operator receives a permit for such source,
the reasonable costs of implementing and enforcing the terms and conditions of any such
permit (not including any court costs or other costs associated with any enforcement
action), until such fee requirement is superseded with respect to such sources by the
Administrator's approval of a fee program under subchapter V of this chapter; and</p>

<p>(M) provide for consultation and participation by local political
subdivisions affected by the plan.</p>

<p>(3)(A) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(1), Nov. 15,
1990, 104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(B) As soon as practicable, the Administrator shall, consistent
with the purposes of this chapter and the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act
of 1974 [15 U.S.C.A. § 791 et seq.], review each State's applicable implementation plans
and report to the State on whether such plans can be revised in relation to fuel burning
stationary sources (or persons supplying fuel to such sources) without interfering with
the attainment and maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard within the
period permitted in this section. If the Administrator determines that any such plan can
be revised, he shall notify the State that a plan revision may be submitted by the State.
Any plan revision which is submitted by the State shall, after public notice and
opportunity for public hearing, be approved by the Administrator if the revision relates
only to fuel burning stationary sources (or persons supplying fuel to such sources), and
the plan as revised complies with paragraph (2) of this subsection. The Administrator
shall approve or disapprove any revision no later than three months after its submission.</p>

<p>(C) Neither the State, in the case of a plan (or portion thereof)
approved under this subsection, nor the Administrator, in the case of a plan (or portion
thereof) promulgated under subsection (c) of this section, shall be required to revise an
applicable implementation plan because one or more exemptions under section 7418 of this
title (relating to Federal facilities), enforcement orders under section 7413(d) of this
title, suspensions under subsection (f) or (g) of this section (relating to temporary
energy or economic authority), orders under section 7419 of this title (relating to
primary nonferrous smelters), or extensions of compliance in decrees entered under section
7413(e) of this title (relating to iron- and steel-producing operations) have been
granted, if such plan would have met the requirements of this section if no such
exemptions, orders, or extensions had been granted.</p>

<p>(D) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(1), Nov. 15, 1990,
104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(4) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(2), Nov. 15, 1990,
104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(5)(A)(i) Any State may include in a State implementation plan, but
the Administrator may not require as a condition of approval of such plan under this
section, any indirect source review program. The Administrator may approve and enforce, as
part of an applicable implementation plan, an indirect source review program which the
State chooses to adopt and submit as part of its plan.</p>

<p>(ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no plan promulgated by
the Administrator shall include any indirect source review program for any air quality
control region, or portion thereof.</p>

<p>(iii) Any State may revise an applicable implementation plan
approved under this subsection to suspend or revoke any such program included in such
plan, provided that such plan meets the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>(B) The Administrator shall have the authority to promulgate,
implement and enforce regulations under subsection (c) of this section respecting indirect
source review programs which apply only to federally assisted highways, airports, and
other major federally assisted indirect sources and federally owned or operated indirect
sources.</p>

<p>(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;indirect
source&quot; means a facility, building, structure, installation, real property, road, or
highway which attracts, or may attract, mobile sources of pollution. Such term includes
parking lots, parking garages, and other facilities subject to any measure for management
of parking supply (within the meaning of subsection (c)(2)(D)(ii) of this section),
including regulation of existing off-street parking but such term does not include new or
existing on-street parking. Direct emissions sources or facilities at, within, or
associated with, any indirect source shall not be deemed indirect sources for the purpose
of this paragraph.</p>

<p>(D) For purposes of this paragraph the term &quot;indirect source
review program&quot; means the facility-by-facility review of indirect sources of air
pollution, including such measures as are necessary to assure, or assist in assuring, that
a new or modified indirect source will not attract mobile sources of air pollution, the
emissions from which would cause or contribute to air pollution concentrations--</p>

<p>(i) exceeding any national primary ambient air quality standard for
a mobile source-related air pollutant after the primary standard attainment date, or</p>

<p>(ii) preventing maintenance of any such standard after such date.</p>

<p>(E) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (2)(B), the term
&quot;transportation control measure&quot; does not include any measure which is an
&quot;indirect source review program&quot;.</p>

<p>(6) No State plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of
this section unless such plan provides that in the case of any source which uses a
supplemental, or intermittent control system for purposes of meeting the requirements of
an order under section 7413(d) of this title or section 7419 of this title (relating to
primary nonferrous smelter orders), the owner or operator of such source may not
temporarily reduce the pay of any employee by reason of the use of such supplemental or
intermittent or other dispersion dependent control system.</p>

<p>(b) Extension of period for submission of plans</p>

<p>The Administrator may, wherever he determines necessary, extend the
period for submission of any plan or portion thereof which implements a national secondary
ambient air quality standard for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date otherwise
required for submission of such plan.</p>

<p>(c) Preparation and publication by Administrator of proposed
regulations setting forth implementation plan; transportation regulations study and
report; parking surcharge; suspension authority; plan implementation</p>

<p>(1) The Administrator shall promulgate a Federal implementation
plan at any time within 2 years after the Administrator--</p>

<p>(A) finds that a State has failed to make a required submission or
finds that the plan or plan revision submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum
criteria established under subsection (k)(1)(A) of this section, or</p>

<p>(B) disapproves a State implementation plan submission in whole or
in part, unless the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan
or plan revision, before the Administrator promulgates such Federal implementation plan.</p>

<p>(2)(A) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(3)(A), Nov. 15,
1990, 104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(B) No parking surcharge regulation may be required by the
Administrator under paragraph (1) of this subsection as a part of an applicable
implementation plan. All parking surcharge regulations previously required by the
Administrator shall be void upon June 22, 1974. This subparagraph shall not prevent the
Administrator from approving parking surcharges if they are adopted and submitted by a
State as part of an applicable implementation plan. The Administrator may not condition
approval of any implementation plan submitted by a State on such plan's including a
parking surcharge regulation.</p>

<p>(C) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(3)(B), Nov. 15,
1990, 104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(D) For purposes of this paragraph--</p>

<p>(i) The term &quot;parking surcharge regulation&quot; means a
regulation imposing or requiring the imposition of any tax, surcharge, fee, or other
charge on parking spaces, or any other area used for the temporary storage of motor
vehicles.</p>

<p>(ii) The term &quot;management of parking supply&quot; shall
include any requirement providing that any new facility containing a given number of
parking spaces shall receive a permit or other prior approval, issuance of which is to be
conditioned on air quality considerations.</p>

<p>(iii) The term &quot;preferential bus/carpool lane&quot; shall
include any requirement for the setting aside of one or more lanes of a street or highway
on a permanent or temporary basis for the exclusive use of buses or carpools, or both.</p>

<p>(E) No standard, plan, or requirement, relating to management of
parking supply or preferential bus/carpool lanes shall be promulgated after June 22, 1974,
by the Administrator pursuant to this section, unless such promulgation has been subjected
to at least one public hearing which has been held in the area affected and for which
reasonable notice has been given in such area. If substantial changes are made following
public hearings, one or more additional hearings shall be held in such area after such
notice.</p>

<p>(3) Upon application of the chief executive officer of any general
purpose unit of local government, if the Administrator determines that such unit has
adequate authority under State or local law, the Administrator may delegate to such unit
the authority to implement and enforce within the jurisdiction of such unit any part of a
plan promulgated under this subsection. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the
Administrator from implementing or enforcing any applicable provision of a plan
promulgated under this subsection.</p>

<p>(4) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(3)(C), Nov. 15,
1990, 104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(5)(A) Any measure in an applicable implementation plan which
requires a toll or other charge for the use of a bridge located entirely within one city
shall be eliminated from such plan by the Administrator upon application by the Governor
of the State, which application shall include a certification by the Governor that he will
revise such plan in accordance with subparagraph (B).</p>

<p>(B) In the case of any applicable implementation plan with respect
to which a measure has been eliminated under subparagraph (A), such plan shall, not later
than one year after August 7, 1977, be revised to include comprehensive measures to:</p>

<p>(i) establish, expand, or improve public transportation measures to
meet basic transportation needs, as expeditiously as is practicable; and</p>

<p>(ii) implement transportation control measures necessary to attain
and maintain national ambient air quality standards, and such revised plan shall, for the
purpose of implementing such comprehensive public transportation measures, include
requirements to use (insofar as is necessary) Federal grants, State or local funds, or any
combination of such grants and funds as may be consistent with the terms of the
legislation providing such grants and funds. Such measures shall, as a substitute for the
tolls or charges eliminated under subparagraph (A), provide for emissions reductions
equivalent to the reductions which may reasonably be expected to be achieved through the
use of the tolls or charges eliminated.</p>

<p>(C) Any revision of an implementation plan for purposes of meeting
the requirements of subparagraph (B) shall be submitted in coordination with any plan
revision required under part D of this subchapter.</p>

<p>(d), (e) Repealed. Pub.L. 101-549, Title I, § 101(d)(4), (5), Nov. 15,
1990, 104 Stat. 2409</p>

<p>(f) National or regional energy emergencies; determination by President</p>

<p>(1) Upon application by the owner or operator of a fuel burning
stationary source, and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Governor of
the State in which such source is located may petition the President to determine that a
national or regional energy emergency exists of such severity that--</p>

<p>(A) a temporary suspension of any part of the applicable
implementation plan or of any requirement under section 7651j of this title (concerning
excess emissions penalties or offsets) may be necessary, and</p>

<p>(B) other means of responding to the energy emergency may be
inadequate.</p>

<p>Such determination shall not be delegable by the President to any other
person. If the President determines that a national or regional energy emergency of such
severity exists, a temporary emergency suspension of any part of an applicable
implementation plan or of any requirement under section 7651j of this title (concerning
excess emissions penalties or offsets) adopted by the State may be issued by the Governor
of any State covered by the President's determination under the condition specified in
paragraph (2) and may take effect immediately.</p>

<p>(2) A temporary emergency suspension under this subsection shall be
issued to a source only if the Governor of such State finds that--</p>

<p>(A) there exists in the vicinity of such source a temporary energy
emergency involving high levels of unemployment or loss of necessary energy supplies for
residential dwellings; and</p>

<p>(B) such unemployment or loss can be totally or partially
alleviated by such emergency suspension.</p>

<p>Not more than one such suspension may be issued for any source on the
basis of the same set of circumstances or on the basis of the same emergency.</p>

<p>(3) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a Governor under
this subsection shall remain in effect for a maximum of four months or such lesser period
as may be specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator, if any. The Administrator
may disapprove such suspension if he determines that it does not meet the requirements of
paragraph (2).</p>

<p>(4) This subsection shall not apply in the case of a plan provision
or requirement promulgated by the Administrator under subsection (c) of this section, but
in any such case the President may grant a temporary emergency suspension for a four month
period of any such provision or requirement if he makes the determinations and findings
specified in paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>

<p>(5) The Governor may include in any temporary emergency suspension
issued under this subsection a provision delaying for a period identical to the period of
such suspension any compliance schedule (or increment of progress) to which such source is
subject under section 1857c-10 of this title, as in effect before August 7, 1977, or
section 7413(d) of this title, upon a finding that such source is unable to comply with
such schedule (or increment) solely because of the conditions on the basis of which a
suspension was issued under this subsection.</p>

<p>(g) Governor's authority to issue temporary emergency suspensions</p>

<p>(1) In the case of any State which has adopted and submitted to the
Administrator a proposed plan revision which the State determines--</p>

<p>(A) meets the requirements of this section, and</p>

<p>(B) is necessary (i) to prevent the closing for one year or more of
any source of air pollution, and (ii) to prevent substantial increases in unemployment
which would result from such closing, and which the Administrator has not approved or
disapproved under this section within 12 months of submission of the proposed plan
revision, the Governor may issue a temporary emergency suspension of the part of the
applicable implementation plan for such State which is proposed to be revised with respect
to such source. The determination under subparagraph (B) may not be made with respect to a
source which would close without regard to whether or not the proposed plan revision is
approved.</p>

<p>(2) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a Governor under
this subsection shall remain in effect for a maximum of four months or such lesser period
as may be specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator. The Administrator may
disapprove such suspension if he determines that it does not meet the requirements of this
subsection.</p>

<p>(3) The Governor may include in any temporary emergency suspension
issued under this subsection a provision delaying for a period identical to the period of
such suspension any compliance schedule (or increment of progress) to which such source is
subject under section 1857c-10 of this title as in effect before August 7, 1977, or under
section 7413(d) of this title upon a finding that such source is unable to comply with
such schedule (or increment) solely because of the conditions on the basis of which a
suspension was issued under this subsection.</p>

<p>(h) Publication of comprehensive document for each State setting forth
requirements of applicable implementation plan</p>

<p>(1) Not later than 5 years after November 15, 1990, and every 3
years thereafter, the Administrator shall assemble and publish a comprehensive document
for each State setting forth all requirements of the applicable implementation plan for
such State and shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the availability of such
documents.</p>

<p>(2) The Administrator may promulgate such regulations as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this subsection.</p>

<p>(i) Modification of requirements prohibited</p>

<p>Except for a primary nonferrous smelter order under section 7419 of
this title, a suspension under subsection (f) or (g) of this section (relating to
emergency suspensions), an exemption under section 7418 of this title (relating to certain
Federal facilities), an order under section 7413(d) of this title (relating to compliance
orders), a plan promulgation under subsection (c) of this section, or a plan revision
under subsection (a)(3) of this section, no order, suspension, plan revision, or other
action modifying any requirement of an applicable implementation plan may be taken with
respect to any stationary source by the State or by the Administrator.</p>

<p>(j) Technological systems of continuous emission reduction on new or
modified stationary sources; compliance with performance standards</p>

<p>As a condition for issuance of any permit required under this
subchapter, the owner or operator of each new or modified stationary source which is
required to obtain such a permit must show to the satisfaction of the permitting authority
that the technological system of continuous emission reduction which is to be used will
enable such source to comply with the standards of performance which are to apply to such
source and that the construction or modification and operation of such source will be in
compliance with all other requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p>(k) Environmental Protection Agency action on plan submissions</p>

<p>(1) Completeness of plan submissions</p>

<p>(A) Completeness criteria</p>

<p>Within 9 months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall
promulgate minimum criteria that any plan submission must meet before the Administrator is
required to act on such submission under this subsection. The criteria shall be limited to
the information necessary to enable the Administrator to determine whether the plan
submission complies with the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p>(B) Completeness finding</p>

<p>Within 60 days of the Administrator's receipt of a plan or plan
revision, but no later than 6 months after the date, if any, by which a State is required
to submit the plan or revision, the Administrator shall determine whether the minimum
criteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A) have been met. Any plan or plan revision
that a State submits to the Administrator, and that has not been determined by the
Administrator (by the date 6 months after receipt of the submission) to have failed to
meet the minimum criteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall on that date be
deemed by operation of law to meet such minimum criteria.</p>

<p>(C) Effect of finding of incompleteness</p>

<p>Where the Administrator determines that a plan submission (or part
thereof) does not meet the minimum criteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the
State shall be treated as not having made the submission (or, in the Administrator's
discretion, part thereof).</p>

<p>(2) Deadline for action</p>

<p>Within 12 months of a determination by the Administrator (or a
determination deemed by operation of law) under paragraph (1) that a State has submitted a
plan or plan revision (or, in the Administrator's discretion, part thereof) that meets the
minimum criteria established pursuant to paragraph (1), if applicable (or, if those
criteria are not applicable, within 12 months of submission of the plan or revision), the
Administrator shall act on the submission in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>

<p>(3) Full and partial approval and disapproval</p>

<p>In the case of any submittal on which the Administrator is required to
act under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall approve such submittal as a whole if it
meets all of the applicable requirements of this chapter. If a portion of the plan
revision meets all the applicable requirements of this chapter, the Administrator may
approve the plan revision in part and disapprove the plan revision in part. The plan
revision shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of this chapter until the
Administrator approves the entire plan revision as complying with the applicable
requirements of this chapter.</p>

<p>(4) Conditional approval</p>

<p>The Administrator may approve a plan revision based on a commitment of
the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than 1
year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Any such conditional approval shall
be treated as a disapproval if the State fails to comply with such commitment.</p>

<p>(5) Calls for plan revisions</p>

<p>Whenever the Administrator finds that the applicable implementation
plan for any area is substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant national
ambient air quality standard, to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport
described in section 7506a of this title or section 7511c of this title, or to otherwise
comply with any requirement of this chapter, the Administrator shall require the State to
revise the plan as necessary to correct such inadequacies. The Administrator shall notify
the State of the inadequacies, and may establish reasonable deadlines (not to exceed 18
months after the date of such notice) for the submission of such plan revisions. Such
findings and notice shall be public. Any finding under this paragraph shall, to the extent
the Administrator deems appropriate, subject the State to the requirements of this chapter
to which the State was subject when it developed and submitted the plan for which such
finding was made, except that the Administrator may adjust any dates applicable under such
requirements as appropriate (except that the Administrator may not adjust any attainment
date prescribed under part D of this subchapter, unless such date has elapsed).</p>

<p>(6) Corrections</p>

<p>Whenever the Administrator determines that the Administrator's action
approving, disapproving, or promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part thereof), area
designation, redesignation, classification, or reclassification was in error, the
Administrator may in the same manner as the approval, disapproval, or promulgation revise
such action as appropriate without requiring any further submission from the State. Such
determination and the basis thereof shall be provided to the State and public.</p>

<p>(l) Plan revisions</p>

<p>Each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under this
chapter shall be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. The
Administrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with
any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress (as
defined in section 7501 of this title), or any other applicable requirement of this
chapter.</p>

<p>(m) Sanctions</p>

<p>The Administrator may apply any of the sanctions listed in section
7509(b) of this title at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes a
finding, disapproval, or determination under paragraphs (1) through (4), respectively, of
section 7509(a) of this title in relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is
defined by the Administrator) required under this chapter, with respect to any portion of
the State the Administrator determines reasonable and appropriate, for the purpose of
ensuring that the requirements of this chapter relating to such plan or plan item are met.
The Administrator shall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his authority under
the previous sentence with respect to any deficiency referred to in section 7509(a) of
this title to ensure that, during the 24-month period following the finding, disapproval,
or determination referred to in section 7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not
applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the
applicable implementation plan are principally responsible for such deficiency.</p>

<p>(n) Savings clauses</p>

<p>(1) Existing plan provisions</p>

<p>Any provision of any applicable implementation plan that was approved
or promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to this section as in effect before November
15, 1990, shall remain in effect as part of such applicable implementation plan, except to
the extent that a revision to such provision is approved or promulgated by the
Administrator pursuant to this chapter.</p>

<p>(2) Attainment dates</p>

<p>For any area not designated nonattainment, any plan or plan revision
submitted or required to be submitted by a State--</p>

<p>(A) in response to the promulgation or revision of a national
primary ambient air quality standard in effect on November 15, 1990, or</p>

<p>(B) in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy under
subsection (a)(2) of this section (as in effect immediately before November 15, 1990),
shall provide for attainment of the national primary ambient air quality standards within
3 years of November 15, 1990, or within 5 years of issuance of such finding of substantial
inadequacy, whichever is later.</p>

<p>(3) Retention of construction moratorium in certain areas</p>

<p>In the case of an area to which, immediately before November 15, 1990,
the prohibition on construction or modification of major stationary sources prescribed in
subsection (a)(2)(I) of this section (as in effect immediately before November 15, 1990)
applied by virtue of a finding of the Administrator that the State containing such area
had not submitted an implementation plan meeting the requirements of section 7502(b)(6) of
this title (relating to establishment of a permit program) (as in effect immediately
before November 15, 1990) or 7502(a)(1) of this title (to the extent such requirements
relate to provision for attainment of the primary national ambient air quality standard
for sulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) as in effect immediately before November 15, 1990,
no major stationary source of the relevant air pollutant or pollutants shall be
constructed or modified in such area until the Administrator finds that the plan for such
area meets the applicable requirements of section 7502(c)(5) of this title (relating to
permit programs) or subpart 5 of part D of this subchapter (relating to attainment of the
primary national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide), respectively.</p>

<p>(o) Indian tribes</p>

<p>If an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to the Administrator
pursuant to section 7601(d) of this title, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with
the provisions for review set forth in this section for State plans, except as otherwise
provided by regulation promulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this title. When such
plan becomes effective in accordance with the regulations promulgated under section
7601(d) of this title, the plan shall become applicable to all areas (except as expressly
provided otherwise in the plan) located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation,
notwithstanding the issuance of any patent and including rights- of-way running through
the reservation.</p>

<p>(p) Reports</p>

<p>Any State shall submit, according to such schedule as the Administrator
may prescribe, such reports as the Administrator may require relating to emission
reductions, vehicle miles traveled, congestion levels, and any other information the
Administrator may deem necessary to assess the development effectiveness, need for
revision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision required under this chapter.</p>
