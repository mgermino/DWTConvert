<h2>Arsenic (As)</h2>

<p>Arsenic is listed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as one of 129 priority
pollutants. Arsenic is also listed among the 25 hazardous substances thought to pose the
most significant potential threat to human health at priority superfund sites.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i> Plants can take
up arsenic in a variety of ways, including from fly ash, sludge, and by manure dumped on
the land. However, it has been found that the edible portions of plants grown on
contaminated sources seldom accumulate dangerous levels of arsenic. Animals are generally
less sensitive to arsenic than plants. Arsenic is one of the most toxic elements to fish. </p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans:</strong></i> Arsenic has long been a concern to man because
small amounts can be toxic to humans. Relatively high doses of arsenic have been reported
to cause bone marrow suppression in humans. Inorganic arsenic in high amounts has been
known for centuries as a fast acting human poison.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> Arsenic is often thought
of as a carcinogenic priority pollutant. Recent reviews indicate arsenic has been
implicated in numerous types of cancer, including skin, bladder, kidney, liver, prostate,
and nasal cavity.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information:</strong></i>
Recent reviews indicate arsenic has been associated with genotoxic, fetotoxic, mutagenic,
and teratogenic impacts. Arsenic does not seem to directly impact DNA but may inhibit some
DNA repair.</p>

<h2>Beryllium<strong> (Be)</strong></h2>

<p>Beryllium is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants, and is considered one
of the 14 most noxious heavy metals.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> All beryllium compounds are potentially
harmful or toxic. However, the probability of beryllium occurring at significantly toxic
levels in ambient natural waters is minimal.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i> In those cases
in which it is elevated in water beryllium is extremely toxic to warm water fish in soft
water.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Effects of Beryllium Upon Humans:</strong></i> Human impacts of beryllium include
severe lung inflammation. Acute exposure to high concentrations of the more soluble
compounds of beryllium can cause chemical pneumonitis, the symptoms of which include
cough, substernal burning, shortness of breath, anorexia, and increasing fatigue.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> Beryllium is a Class B2
carcinogen, (i.e., a probable human carcinogen). Beryllium has been shown to induce lung
cancer via inhalation in rats and monkeys and to induce osteosarcomas in rabbits.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine and Genotoxicity Information:</strong></i>
Beryllium has been shown to be teratogenic in snails, and to cause developmental problems
in salamanders. Impacts on humans are unknown. </p>

<h2>Cadmium (Cd)</h2>

<p>Cadmium is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants. Cadmium is also listed
among the 25 hazardous substances thought to pose the most significant potential threat to
human health at priority superfund sites.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> Cadmium ions are extremely poisonous; their
action is similar to those of mercury. Cadmium acts as a cumulative poison. All cadmium
compounds are potentially harmful or toxic. </p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i> Cadmium is very
toxic to a variety of species of fish and wildlife. Cadmium causes behavior, growth, and
physiological problems in aquatic life at sublethal concentrations. Cadmium is the only
metal that clearly accumulates with increasing age of the animal, and the kidneys are the
preferred site of cadmium accumulation.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Effects of Cadmium Upon Humans:</strong></i> All cadmium compounds are potentially
harmful or toxic. It has been implicated as a cause of human deaths. Kidney and/or liver
damage have followed respiratory exposures in industry. Inhalation of cadmium dusts,
salts, and fumes over a number of years can cause kidney and bone marrow diseases and
emphysema.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> Cadmium is listed by EPA
as a Class B1 carcinogen (i.e., a probable human carcinogen by inhalation).</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine and Genotoxicity Information:
Cadmium is listed as having some endocrine disruptive activities. Cadmium has been shown
to cause birth defects in mammals.</p>

<h2>Chromium, General (Cr)</h2>

<p>Chromium (Cr) is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants. Chromium is
considered one of the 14 most noxious heavy metals. Chromium is also listed among the 25
hazardous substances thought to pose the most significant potential threat to human health
at priority superfund sites.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary: </strong></i>The EPA regards all chromium compounds as
toxic. Hexavalent chromium causes cellular damage via its role as a strong oxidizing
agent, whereas trivalent chromium can inhibit various enzyme systems or react with organic
molecules.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i> In plants
chromium interferes with uptake translocation and accumulation by plant tops of calcium,
potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, boron, copper, and aggravates iron deficiency chlorosis
by interfering with iron metabolism. In mammalian species chromium is considered one of
the least toxic trace elements, as normal stomach pH converts hexavalent chromium to
trivalent chromium.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans:</strong></i> Hexavalent chromium is associated with cancer risk
and kidney damage. Certain hexavalent chromium compounds when administered via inhalation
at high doses have the potential to induce lung tumors in humans and experimental animals.
However, at low levels of exposure hexavalent chromium ions are reduced in humans bodily.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> Chromium in general is
listed by EPA as a Class A human carcinogen. Some salts of chromium are carcinogenic and
humans exposed to chromium fumes have an increased risk for lung cancer.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information</strong></i>:
Hexavalent chromium is associated with cancer risk and kidney damage, and may cause damage
to DNA and many other tissue structures.</p>

<h2>Copper (Cu)</h2>

<p>Copper is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> Although copper in water is a hazard to many
aquatic organisms minute amounts of copper in the diet are needed for human, plant, and
animal enzymes.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i> Elevated
concentrations of copper in water are particularly toxic to many species of algae,
bacilli, fungi, crustaceans, annelids, cyprinids, and salmonids. Most adult fish are able
to tolerate relatively high concentrations of copper for short periods of time. The
critical effect of copper is its greater toxicity to younger fish.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans:</strong></i> Copper poisoning or deficiency problems are rare
in humans.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> Copper is not classifiable
as to human carcinogenicity. There is inadequate animal carcinogenicity data on copper.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information</strong>:</i>
Reproductive effects on animals are noted at low levels of copper. Incubation of human
spermatozoa with metallic copper is found to bring about a significant fall in the
percentage of motile sperm in humans.</p>

<h2>Lead (Pb)</h2>

<p>Lead is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants. Lead is also listed among
the 25 hazardous substances thought to pose the most significant potential threat to human
health at priority superfund sites.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> All measured effects of lead on living
organisms are adverse, including those related to survival, growth, learning,
reproduction, development, behavior, and metabolism.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i> Lead is a heavy
metal that is very toxic to aquatic organisms, especially fish. In fish lead deposits in
active calcification areas such as scales, fin rays, vertebrae, and opercula. In
vertebrates sublethal lead poisoning is characterized by neurological problems, kidney
dysfunction, enzyme inhibition, and anemia.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans</strong>:</i> Lead poisoning is particularly dangerous in young
children (who may ingest lead by eating lead-containing chips of paint); it may result in
anorexia and--in severe cases--permanent brain damage. Women in the workplace are more
likely to experience adverse effects from lead exposure than men because their
hematopoietic system is more lead sensitive than men's.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> Lead is listed by EPA as a
Class B2 carcinogen. There is sufficient evidence to be classed as an animal carcinogen.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information:</strong></i>
Adverse effects of lead on living organisms include those negatively affecting
reproduction and development. Effects of sublethal concentrations of lead include delayed
embryonic development, suppressed reproduction, inhibition of growth, and fin erosion.</p>

<h2>Mercury (Hg)</h2>

<p>Mercury is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> Major sources to atmosphere include
incineration of municipal waste, landfills, Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
sites, sewage sludge burning, and medical waste incinerators.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, Invertebrates, Plants, and Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i>
Mercury is one of the few metals which strongly bioconcentrates and biomagnifies and has
only harmful effects with no useful physiological functions when present in fish and
wildlife. The most sensitive target of low-level exposure to metallic or organic mercury
following short- or long-term exposures appear to be the nervous system. The most
sensitive target of low-level exposure to inorganic mercury appears to be the kidneys.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans:</strong></i> Human exposure to methyl mercury is almost
entirely due to consumption of fish. Potential impacts to human health are real and
potentially great. Mercury deposits in human kidneys may lead to renal failure. Children
and persons with a history of allergies or known sensitization to mercury, chronic
respiratory disease, nervous system disorders, or kidney disorders are at increased risk
to mercury poisoning. Many mercury compounds are irritating to skin and may produce
dermatitis with or without vesication. Contact with eyes cause ulceration of conjunctiva
and cornea. Mercury deposits in the brain cause many disorders and sometimes dementia in
humans.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong> </i>Mercury is not
classifiable as to human carcinogenicity, based on inadequate human and animal data.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information:</strong>
</i>Methyl mercury can denature DNA and can otherwise interact with both DNA and RNA to
alter their structures.</p>

<h2>Nickel (Ni)</h2>

<p>Nickel is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants, and is considered to be
one of the 14 most noxious heavy metals. Nickel is also listed among the 25 hazardous
substances thought to pose the most significant potential threat to human health at
priority superfund sites.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> Low absorption from the GI tract causes nickel
compounds to be essentially nontoxic after ingestion.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, Invertebrates, Plants, or Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i>
Mixtures of nickel, copper, and zinc produced additive toxicity effects on rainbow trout.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans:</strong></i> Nickel is toxic to humans as a dust or powder. The
organs that are affected by exposure to nickel, metal, and soluble compounds (as Ni) are
nasal cavities, lungs, and skin.</p>
<strong><i>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</i> </strong>Nickel, in general, is not
considered a carcinogen.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information:</strong></i>
Study results indicate that nickel is a developmental toxicant in animals, but it is not
known whether occupational or environmental exposure to nickel could result in
developmental effects in humans.<strong></p>
</strong>

<h2>Zinc (Zn)</h2>

<p>Zinc is listed by the EPA as one of 129 priority pollutants.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>General Hazard/Toxicity Summary:</strong></i> Zinc in low to moderate amounts is of very low
toxicity in its ordinary compounds and in low concentrations is an essential element in
plant and animal life.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Potential Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, Invertebrates, Plants, or Other Non-Human Biota:</strong></i>
Elevated concentrations of zinc in water are particularly toxic to many species of algae,
crustaceans, and salmonids. In mammals excess zinc can cause copper deficiencies, affect
iron metabolism, and interact with the chemical dynamics of lead and drugs.</p>
<strong><i>

<p>Potential Hazards to Humans:</i> </strong>In humans, prolonged excessive dietary intake of
zinc can lead to deficiencies in iron and copper, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache,
tiredness, and abdominal pain. Zinc is a human skin irritant.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Carcinogenicity/Cancer Information:</strong></i> There are no reports on
the possible carcinogenicity of zinc and compounds per se in humans.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Brief Summary of Developmental, Reproductive, Endocrine, and Genotoxicity Information:</strong></i>
The risk associated with maternal ingestion of large amounts of zinc in human pregnancy is
unknown.</p>
