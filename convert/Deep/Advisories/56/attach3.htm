<p>The four scenarios that will typically be encountered when regulating burn dumps are: 

<ol>
  <li>Minimal action required.</li>
  <li>Leave burn ash in place and cap. </li>
  <li>Consolidate burn ash on site or on another adjacent parcel that already contains burn
    ash and cap.</li>
  <li>Clean closure of the burn dump site.</li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Scenario 1, Minimal Action Required<br />
</strong><i>(Refer to</i> <a href="FigureA.htm">Figure A</a><i>, &quot;Leave Ash in Place with
Minimal Action Required&quot;)</i></p>

<p>Under this scenario a determination is made through the Site Investigation Process
(SIP) that at the site in question there is no exposed burn ash, no proposed postclosure
land use (PCLU), and that the current land use does not pose an immediate threat to public
health and safety and the environment. If the site is located in an area that is
accessible to the public the owner may be required to fence and post the site to limit
access and to warn the public that a burn dump is present. For sites that fit this
scenario there would likely be no other mitigation measures or actions proposed for
managing the burn ash at the site. The procedure shown on <a href="FigureA.htm">Figure A</a>
would then be followed. </p>

<p>Generally, waste characterization will not be required for sites under this scenario
because there are no proposed actions at the site. In the future, if site conditions were
to change (e.g., erosion of the cover or PCLU), waste characterization may be warranted.</p>

<p>The primary concerns for sites that fit this scenario are changes in site conditions
that might pose a threat to public health and safety and the environment or changes in
land use. The following actions can be taken to identify and minimize the risk of such
changes: 

<ul>
  <li>A determination should be made of whether erosion control is needed to protect the cover
    at the site.</li>
  <li>If it has not already been done the Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) should determine
    whether the owner should provide site security and limit public access by fencing the site
    and posting a sign warning the public that a burn dump is present. This determination
    should be based on current relative risk to human health and safety and the environment
    (e.g., increase in adjacent population).</li>
  <li>The owner should be notified in writing by the LEA that future development of the
    property will be subject to the PCLU requirements contained in California Code of </li>
  <li>Regulations, Title 27 (27 CCR), section 21190 and that any proposed change in land use
    must be approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.</li>
  <li>A deed notification or restriction should be placed on the title of the property to
    limit the types of PCLU that are allowed on the site and to also notify the appropriate
    agencies when a PCLU is being proposed for construction on the site. A deed restriction
    will also notify prospective buyers that the property contains a burn dump and the buyer
    will assume all responsibility for managing it should they purchase the property. Lastly,
    it would require that the owner notify the LEA of changes in ownership. The procedure to
    follow in recording a typical deed restriction for a burn dump is contained in<a href="Attach4.htm"> Attachment 4</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p><a name="Scenario 2,">Scenario 2,</a> Leave Burn Ash in Place and Cap<br />
</strong><i>(Refer to </i><a href="FigureB.htm">Figure B</a><i>, &quot;Leave Ash in Place and
Cap&quot;)</i></p>

<p>Under this scenario it has been determined through the SIP process that there is
exposed burn ash or potential exposure of burn ash at the site in question but no proposed
PCLU. The primary human health threat associated with burn dump sites under this scenario
is exposure through direct contact with the burn ash or exposure to windblown particulates
that have been contaminated with burn ash. Therefore, the best mitigation might be to
simply cap the exposed burn ash. The procedure shown on <a href="FigureB.htm">Figure B</a>
should be followed to mitigate the sites that fit this scenario.</p>

<p>The first step under this scenario is to determine whether the site poses an immediate
threat to public health and safety and the environment. To determine the immediate threat
to public health and safety and the environment the owner is required to perform waste
characterization on the burn ash material. To ensure a proper waste characterization the
owner should submit a waste characterization workplan to the LEA for approval. Waste
characterization is necessary to define the limits of the waste and to determine whether
the waste is hazardous. This information will ensure that all exposed burn ash is properly
capped and that appropriate measures are incorporated into the site health and safety plan
and properly implemented during the capping activities.</p>

<p>A waste characterization of the burn ash will likely show that it is a hazardous waste
and would therefore be subject to the hazardous waste regulations and Department of Toxic
Substances Control (DTSC) oversight and approval. However, in a memorandum dated March 3,
1995, DTSC states that if there is no active management of the burn ash material (i.e.,
the burn ash will be left in place and capped) the &quot;...regulations regarding the
management of hazardous waste do not apply&quot;. In other words, DTSC does not require
that the owner of the burn dump site obtain DTSC approval of on-site activities to
consolidate and cover the ash, nor is the owner required to obtain a DTSC variance in
order for the LEA to oversee these capping activities.</p>

<p>It should be noted that even though DTSC has made the policy decision that the burn ash
does not need to be managed as a hazardous waste under this scenario, the LEA must still
make the necessary notifications as required under the Safe Drinking Water &amp; Toxic
Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65), Health and Safety Code sections 25249.5 et. seq.</p>

<p>In the event that the analyses show that the burn ash cannot be classified as a
hazardous waste DTSC coordination would not be necessary. Regardless of whether the waste
is hazardous or not, the LEA should coordinate with the Regional Water Quality Control
Board (RWQCB).</p>

<p>After the burn dump site is capped (e.g., covered with two feet of compacted earthen
material) the owner should provide site security (e.g., fencing and posting the area where
burn ash remains). This will limit public access to the site.</p>

<p>Next, a deed notification or restriction should be placed on the title of the property
to limit the types of PCLU that can be constructed on the site and to also notify the
appropriate agencies when a PCLU is being proposed for construction on the site. It will
also notify any prospective buyers that the property contains a burn dump and the buyer
will assume all responsibility for managing it should they purchase the property. Lastly,
it would require that the owner notify the LEA of changes in ownership. The procedure to
follow in recording a typical deed restriction for a burn dump is contained in <a href="Attach4.htm">Attachment 4</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the LEA should notify DTSC of the location and actions taken at the burn dump
site and should also continue to monitor the site for illegal dumping, PCLU, or erosion of
the cap.<strong></p>

<p>Scenario 3, Consolidate Burn Ash on Site or on a Contiguous Parcel That Already
Contains Burn Ash</strong><i></p>

<p>(Refer to </i><a href="FigureC.htm">Figure C</a><i>, &quot;Consolidate Ash, Either On
Site or on a Contiguous Parcel that Already Contains Ash&quot;)</i></p>

<p>Under this scenario there are multiple burn dump sites on one property or the burn ash
is shallow and spread over a large area. There may or may not be exposed burn ash on the
site. There is no existing or proposed PCLU that would pose a threat to public health and
safety and environment. Under these conditions one possible mitigation would be to
consolidate these sites into fewer sites or even one site.</p>

<p>The primary human health threat associated with burn dump sites is exposure through
direct contact with the burn ash or exposure to windblown particulates that have been
contaminated with burn ash. Therefore, appropriate health and safety measures should be
implemented during excavation and movement of the burn ash material. If the owner does not
want to develop the property the site can be remediated in place and maintained by the
owner. The procedure shown on <a href="FigureC.htm">Figure C</a> should be followed.</p>

<p>Because the burn ash will be excavated and moved under this scenario a waste
characterization is necessary to define the limits of the waste and to determine whether
the waste is hazardous. This information will ensure that 1) all exposed burn ash is
identified and properly capped, and 2) appropriate measures are incorporated into the site
health and safety plan and are properly implemented.</p>

<p>A waste characterization of the burn ash will likely show that it is a hazardous waste.
However, as long as the burn ash material is only moved and consolidated on site or onto a
contiguous pre-contaminated parcel DTSC would not consider this active management of
hazardous waste. Therefore, the hazardous waste regulations would not apply under this
scenario and the LEA could use 27 CCR regulations to regulate these sites. As stated
previously in <a href="#Scenario 2,">Scenario 2</a> the LEA must still make the
necessary notifications as required under Proposition 65.</p>

<p>Since excavation of the burn ash will occur during the consolidation of the burn dump
sites, the excavation activities should follow guidance contained in<a href="../26/default.htm"> LEA Advisory Number 26</a>, Excavation Permit.</p>

<p>Lastly, the purpose of consolidation of one or more burn dumps is clean closure of the
portions of the site from which burn ash is removed. Therefore, guidance contained in <a href="../16/default.htm">LEA Advisory Number 16</a>, Clean Closure, is recommended to be
followed to ensure that the clean closure is complete and documented.</p>

<p>Once the consolidation activities are complete the burn ash can be covered with at
least two feet of earthen material and graded to drain. If the finished grades are
relatively steep the owner should provide erosion protection. In many cases more than two
feet of cover material are necessary. The owner should also provide confirmation sampling
of the &quot;clean closed&quot; areas to verify all burn ash materials have been removed.</p>

<p>After the burn ash is capped the owner should provide site security to limit public
access (e.g., fencing and posting the area where burn ash remains).</p>

<p>Next, a deed notification or restriction should be placed on the title of the property
to limit the types of PCLU that can be constructed on the site and to also notify the
appropriate agencies when a PCLU is being proposed for construction on the site. The deed
notification or restriction will also notify any prospective buyers that the property
contains a burn dump and the buyer will assume all responsibility for managing it should
they purchase the property. It would require that the owner notify the LEA of changes in
ownership. The procedure to follow in recording a typical deed restriction for a burn dump
is contained in<a href="Attach4.htm"> Attachment 4</a><a href="#Attachment 4">.</a></p>

<p>Lastly, the LEA should notify DTSC of the location and actions taken at the site and
they should also continue to monitor the site for illegal dumping, PCLU, or erosion of the
cap.<strong></p>

<p>Scenario 4, Clean Closure<br />
</strong><i>(Refer to </i><a href="FigureD.htm">Figure D</a><i>, &quot;Clean Closure for a Site
that Contains Ash&quot;)</i></p>

<p>Under this scenario the burn dump site, or a portion of the site if consolidation has
occurred, will be clean closed. This means that all the burn ash at the site is removed
and transported off-site to an appropriate disposal site.</p>

<p>The primary human health threat associated with burn dump sites is exposure through
direct contact with the burn ash or exposure to windblown particulates that have been
contaminated with burn ash. Therefore, appropriate health and safety measures should be
implemented during excavation of the ash material. The procedure shown on<strong> </strong><a href="FigureD.htm">Figure D</a> should be followed for sites that fit this scenario.</p>

<p>Since the burn ash will be excavated and moved waste characterization is necessary to
determine the proper disposal site for the burn ash and to also ensure that appropriate
measures are incorporated into a health and safety plan and properly implemented during
the excavation of the burn ash material.</p>

<p>A waste characterization of the burn ash will likely show that it is a hazardous waste.
But as long as the waste is not a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous
waste and passes the Deionized Water Waste Extraction Test (DI WET) it can be regulated
using 27 CCR regulations. However, the LEA must still make the necessary notifications as
required under Proposition 65. Also, as stated in a memorandum dated March 3, 1995, DTSC
must first issue a variance for the burn ash before it is allowed to be disposed of at a
non-Class I disposal facility.</p>

<p>Guidance contained in <a href="../16/">LEA Advisory Number 16</a>, Clean Closure,
should be followed to ensure clean closure is complete and documented.</p>

<p>Also, once clean closure of the burn dump site is achieved and certified clean by the
LEA, DTSC, and the RWQCB the owner would be free to develop the site without any
additional land use restrictions or postclosure maintenance requirements.</p>
