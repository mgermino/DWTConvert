    <strong>&nbsp;To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong>

    <p>The purpose of this advisory is to provide guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA)
and Board staff on the proper completion of Solid Waste Information System (SWIS)
inspection forms for disposal sites and transfer stations. Since the SWIS forms
provide vital information for the state-wide SWIS database, it is critical that the
information be consistent, accurate and current.&nbsp;In addition, since the SWIS forms
have recently been modified, this advisory will highlight specific changes relative to
previous inspection forms and will provide general guidance on the proper completion of
the amended forms.&nbsp;Attached are copies of the inspection report forms, 
	<a href="../../Forms/Inspection/CIWMB052.pdf">CIWMB052</a>
for
disposal sites (Fillable PDF, 1.7 MB) and 
	<a href="../../Forms/Inspection/CIWMB053.pdf">CIWMB053</a> for transfer stations (Fillable 
	PDF, 1.7 MB). </p>

<p><strong>General Guidelines</strong> </p>

<p>The following general guidelines apply to the completion of <strong>ALL</strong> SWIS forms: 

<ul>
  <li>Old versions of the Disposal Site and Transfer Station SWIS forms should <strong>no longer be
    used</strong> for inspection reports. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>LEA inspectors should use the pre-printed, original SWIS forms (not photocopies) to
    report their inspection results.&nbsp;The white copy should be submitted to the
    appropriate Board Enforcement staff contact, the yellow copy to the operator, and the pink
    copy kept for LEA records. Please contact the appropriate Enforcement Branch staff
    for additional forms when needed. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the event that SWIS forms are unavailable, photocopies of SWIS forms may be used.&nbsp;The LEA must ensure that the entire form is copied, that all State Minimum Standards&nbsp;(Standards) are included on the sheet and that the copy quality is comparable to an
  original.&nbsp;Moreover, since a completed SWIS form is public record, the original copy
  (filled out by &nbsp;the inspector at the time of inspection) must be submitted to Board
  Enforcement staff.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>All information at the top of the form should be filled out.&nbsp;Time in, time out,
    and inspection time are optional, and are to be used at the discretion of the LEA.
    Board staff suggest, however, that this information be included to document the time
    of day when the inspection took place. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>All violations and areas of concern should be checked in the appropriate boxes, and <strong>an
    explanation of each should be given in the &quot;Comments Section&quot;</strong>.
    The
    explanation should include the Standard number as well as whether it is a &quot;V&quot;
    (violation) or an &quot;A&quot; (area of concern). The purpose of this requirement
    is to clarify and document the nature of each&nbsp; problem.&nbsp;Additionally it serves as a
    cross-check that the correct box was marked. It is essential that this cross-check
    be completed, to verify the accuracy of the standards marked, particularly with the
    elimination of the compliance &quot;C&quot; column. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When a violation or an area of concern is noted, the discussion should also include,
    when applicable, a <strong>description of the specific actions required of the operator to
    correct the problem</strong>. <dl>
      <dt>The following is an example of an appropriate comment for a violation: </dt>
      <ul>
        <li>17684 - Intermediate Cover: V - &quot;Observed exposed waste located on the
          southeastern portion of Cell 3. Operator was advised to properly cover the area with
          12 inches of compacted soil.&quot; </li>
      </ul>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Additional pages may be attached to the SWIS form to fully discuss all violations and
    areas of concern. The Board provides a three-part comments page (CIWMB-SWIS-03).
    If in-house inspection reports are produced for an inspection then those reports may
    be attached to the SWIS form in lieu of the Comments Section, with a note in the Comments
    Section to &quot;See attached.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If no violations or areas of concern are found, the inspector should write a comment to
    that effect, such as &quot;<strong>satisfactory compliance</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>no violations
    noted</strong>.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When violations or areas of concern noted on previous SWIS reports have been corrected,
    a comment to that effect should be included in the Comments Section. The following
    is an example of an appropriate comment for a correction implemented: <ul>
      <li>Corrections Implemented: 17684 - Intermediate Cover (from x/xx/94 report) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When a recurring violation or area of concern has not been corrected, it should be so
    noted in the Comments Section, along with a description of the specific actions required
    of the operator to correct the problem. This will document the status of the
    operator to achieve compliance since the last inspection. Additionally, the status
    on any issued Notice and Order can be documented on a continuing basis. The
    following is an example of an appropriate comment for ongoing violations: <ul>
      <li>Ongoing Violation: 17705 - Gas Control - Operator submitted preliminary plans on
        May 1, 1994. Phase II is scheduled for completion by June 13, 1994. </li>
      <li>Notice &amp; Order # 94-01 is still in effect. &nbsp;Operator is complying with current
        timelines. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Use of &quot;NA&quot; (not applicable) should also be explained in the Comments Section
    to document the reason for its use. This designation should only be used when the
    standard does not apply, and not if the inspector did not evaluate it for some reason.
    Since monthly inspections are complete inspections, inspectors should evaluate all
    standards that are applicable to the site. <blockquote>
      <p>Examples of appropriate uses of &quot;NA&quot; include the following: <ul>
        <li>Tire standards for sites that do not have any tire storage piles; </li>
        <li>Closure standards for sites that are not in or approaching closure; </li>
        <li>Subtitle D (&quot;Other&quot;) standards for sites that are exempt from Subtitle D
          requirements; </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of <strong>inappropriate</strong> uses of the &quot;NA&quot; designation include the
      following: <ul>
        <li>Permitting standards; </li>
        <li>Any other applicable standard that the inspector did not evaluate. </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Other useful information that may be written in the Comments Section include site status
    (if inactive, closed, etc.) and tonnage received. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When inspecting large volume transfer stations (LVTS), the inspector should place a
    diagonal line through the small volume transfer station (SVTS) Standards to indicate they
    are not being used.&nbsp;Similarly, when inspecting SVTS, a diagonal line should be made
    through all the LVTS Standards. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>All SWIS forms should be checked for accuracy and completeness by LEA staff before
    submission to the Board. Notes in the Comments Section should assist LEA staff in
    performing this task, since each standard marked would be discussed in the Comments
    Section. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Completed SWIS forms should be submitted to Board Enforcement Branch staff within 30
    days of the inspection pursuant to Public Resources Code 43218. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overview of Changes</strong> </p>

<p>The new forms referred to in this advisory are the Disposal Site Inspection 
Report <a href="../../Forms/Inspection/CIWMB052.pdf">CIWMB052</a>
for
disposal sites (Fillable PDF, 1.7 MB) and 
<a href="../../Forms/Inspection/CIWMB053.pdf">CIWMB053</a> for transfer stations (Fillable 
PDF, 1.7 MB). Some of the changes discussed below are in relation to the interim forms (revised in
July 1993), and others are in relation to the previous Notice of Inspection forms SWIS-09
and SWIS-08. </p>

<p>In an effort to streamline the process of filling out SWIS forms, the new forms will no
longer require checking &quot;C&quot; for compliance. The inspector will only use a
check-mark for a standard if it is a violation, area of concern or not applicable to the
site. </p>

<p>The &quot;Not Evaluated&quot; box which was added to the interim forms has also been
removed from the SWIS form, since all standards should be evaluated unless they are
&quot;Not Applicable.&quot; If an inspector conducts more than one inspection per
month, one of which is for the sole purpose of re-checking a particular standard, this
should be noted in the Comments Section.&nbsp;For example, for an additional inspection
of a landfill gas problem, the inspector might write, &quot;Recheck on Gas Control 17705
only,&quot; or a similar comment indicating that this was not a regular monthly
inspection. </p>

<p>The Comments Section has been moved to the bottom of the forms. This section
should be used, along with any additional pages necessary, to explain all violations and
areas of concern (see General Guidelines for further information on use of this section). </p>

<p>New standards have been added to the forms; some were added to the interim forms, and
some to the new forms. The standards added to the <strong>Disposal Site Inspection Report</strong>
form are listed below. Those added after the interim forms are identified with an asterisk
(*). </p>

<p>Please note that the purpose of this LEA Advisory is to outline, in as much detail as
possible, the specific requirements for completing a SWIS inspection form.&nbsp;Since the
SWIS forms are the Board's major source of information about ongoing operations at solid
waste facilities throughout the state, it is vital that the information in them be
accurate, complete and timely. It is the intent of this advisory to establish
greater procedural consistency among LEAs in terms of how the SWIS forms are completed.
Please contact your <a href="../../CountyAssign.asp">CalRecycle permitting, 
inspection or enforcement staff person</a> if you have any additional
questions. </p>
