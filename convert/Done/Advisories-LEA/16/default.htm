    <strong>&nbsp;To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong>

<h2>What is &quot;Clean Closure&quot;? </h2>

<p>Clean closure of a solid waste disposal site refers to the complete removal of all
waste and waste residuals, including contaminated soils. A clean closure is
generally defined as being successful when waste materials and residuals are removed to a
point where remaining contaminant concentrations are at or below background levels or
clean up levels established by the relevant regulatory agencies. &nbsp;Clean closure is an
alternative to more conventional closure methods (closure with waste in place) described
in Title 14, California Code of Regulations (14 CCR), Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 7.8,
and 23 CCR, Division 3, Chapter 15, Article 8. Clean closure may also be considered
a remedial action or a step in a remedial action in some cases. </p>

<p>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) has not adopted regulations
specifically concerning clean closure. However, the Board's Closure and Remediation
Branch has developed a set of guidelines for Board and Local Enforcement Agency (LEA)
staff to follow when overseeing a clean closure. The following guidelines should <strong>not</strong>
be construed as regulations. These guidelines, however, are consistent with existing law
and regulations and are intended to ensure that public health and safety and the
environment are protected from pollution due to the disposal of solid waste. These
guidelines are also intended to provide a basis to allow Board and LEA staff of varying
background and expertise to deal with clean closure issues in a consistent manner. </p>

<h2>What Sites are Candidates for Clean Closure? </h2>

<p>Clean closure may be an appropriate alternative for permitted, illegal, or abandoned
solid waste disposal sites. Clean closure may also be an appropriate action for
sites which closed prior to the current closure regulations, but which are facing a change
in land use which may threaten the integrity of the closed site or pose a threat to public
health and safety and the environment. Also, clean closure may be an appropriate
part of a remedial action for previously closed sites which have developed environmental
problems. Sites that generally lend themselves to clean closure include, but are not
limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>Small landfills and burn dumps; </li>
  <li>Non-hazardous woodwaste disposal sites; </li>
  <li>Solid and liquid waste treatment and/or </li>
  <li>processing units; and </li>
  <li>Sites where the cost of clean closure would be less than or equal to the costs of long
    term monitoring and postclosure maintenance of the site. </li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the Benefits of Clean Closure? </h2>

<p>A properly performed clean closure ensures that waste materials and residuals are
removed and disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound manner. In addition, clean
closing a disposal site can create several advantages for an owner/operator. If done
properly, the clean closure of an entire waste management unit (e.g., a landfill cell or
contiguous group of cells) would eliminate the need for the following for that unit: (1)
30 years or more of postclosure maintenance; (2) potential future corrective actions; and
(3) Board and LEA inspections of the site. While the clean closure of an illegal
disposal site eliminates the necessity for LEA and Board staff inspections, in some areas,
particularly rural areas where the use of such sites by local residents has become
habitual, continued or even increased inspections may be needed temporarily to prevent
reactivation of the illegal disposal site. By clean closing, an owner/operator may
also increase the possible postclosure land uses for the site. Furthermore, clean
closure plans are typically less involved than conventional closure plans.&nbsp;However,
the owner/operator will have to evaluate the potential costs and benefits of clean closure
versus those of a conventional closure on a site-by-site basis to determine the viability
of this option. </p>

<h2>What Does the Clean Closure Process Involve? </h2>

<p>The clean closure of a solid waste disposal site is a multiple step process.&nbsp;The
steps may include, but are not limited to: 

<ol>
  <li>Site characterization; </li>
  <li>Clean closure plan preparation; </li>
  <li>Review and approval; </li>
  <li>The actual clean closure; and </li>
  <li>Verification and approval of the clean closure. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Who Evaluates Clean Closure Proposals? </h2>

<p>Adequate advance notification of the appropriate regulatory agencies (Board, Regional
Water Quality Control Board [RWQCB], LEA, and in some cases the Air Pollution Control
District [APCD] and/or Department of Toxic Substances Control [DTSC] or other agencies as
necessary) is necessary to allow review and approval of any proposals as well as
observation of the site prior to, during, and after clean closure to verify that the site
has been properly clean closed. For clean closures of permitted solid waste disposal sites
and those which are subject to 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 5, Article 3.4, the review and
approval process for clean closure plans is the same as that for conventional closure
plans and is described in 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 5, Article 3.4. For other
sites, the position of coordinating agency for the review and the timeline for the
submittal and review of documents by the various agencies should be agreed upon by the
agencies at the beginning of each project. The timely submittal of appropriate
documentation (e.g., site characterization studies or clean closure plans) allows the
approving agencies an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed clean closure
prior to the actual clean closure of the site.&nbsp;Failure to involve all of the
regulatory agencies early in the clean closure process may lead to lack of final approval
of the clean closure of the site and the application of the regulatory requirements
described below. </p>

<p>The Board (Closure and Remediation Branch), RWQCB, and LEA must each make a final
determination that a solid waste disposal site has been properly clean closed.&nbsp;The
determination that a site has been successfully clean closed implies that the potential
threats to public health and safety and the environment due to the disposal of solid waste
at the site have been mitigated by the clean closure.&nbsp;An owner/operator must provide
to these agencies an adequate characterization of the site and satisfactory evidence that
all waste and waste residuals were removed and properly disposed of. If these
agencies determine a clean closure was not properly completed, 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter
3, Article 7.8, and 23 CCR, Division 3, Chapter 15, may apply to the site. If the
site was operating on or after January 1, 1988, 14 CCR Division 7, Chapter 5, Articles 3.4
and 3.5 will most likely also apply. </p>

<h2>What Information Should be Provided in Clean Closure Proposals? </h2>

<p>The minimum components of a clean closure plan should include, but not be limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>Site characterization; </li>
  <li>Excavation and material management; </li>
  <li>Confirmation of waste and degraded material removal; and </li>
  <li>Postclosure maintenance and land use. </li>
</ul>

<p>The plan should be prepared by a registered civil engineer, a certified engineering
geologist, or other qualified person depending on the complexity of the site. The owner
/operator should submit all information regarding clean closure proposals, including clean
closure plans, to all of the appropriate regulatory agencies. </p>

<blockquote>
  <strong><p>Site Characterization</strong> </p>
  <p>The site characterization phase of the clean closure process is probably the most
  critical phase as it will determine the suitability of the site for clean closure.
  A
  complete site characterization will define the extent and character of the wastes present
  and the levels and extent of any contamination due to the disposal of waste at the site.&nbsp;A complete site characterization may prevent unplanned for and expensive surprises
  after the actual clean closure process has been initiated. Depending upon the
  complexity of the site, it may be necessary or advisable to involve the regulatory
  agencies prior to or during the site characterization process to ensure that an adequate
  characterization is performed. <ul>
    <li>For sites with known or suspected environmental problems, site characterization may
      occur under an enforcement order by one or more regulatory agencies who may require
      submittal of a workplan prior to the site characterization. </li>
    <li>For complicated sites, it may be beneficial to submit the results of the site
      characterization study to the regulatory agencies for review prior to development of the
      clean closure plan rather than as part of the clean closure plan. </li>
    <li>For relatively uncomplicated sites, it may be adequate to submit the results of the site
      characterization with the clean closure plan for review. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The owner/operator should supply the following information regarding the site: <ul>
    <li>Name and legal description of the site. </li>
    <li>Description of the historical development of the site. </li>
    <li>Name of legal owner/operator, including title, address, and telephone number. </li>
    <li>Map showing the assessor's parcel number, site plot plan, and parcel map including:
      legal boundaries of the site and adjacent land use, location of existing and proposed
      footprint of refuse/waste, location of all structures within a 1000-foot radius of the
      site, including all existing and proposed (if any) environmental monitoring, collection,
      and control systems. </li>
    <li>A description of all refuse/waste materials encountered at the site including how the
      waste was generated and the method of disposal used. Provide type of waste, volume,
      and dimensions of each disposal area at the site. &nbsp;Include any chemical
      characterization of the waste if available or if requested by the regulatory agencies. </li>
    <li>If burning of waste occurred at the site, a chemical characterization of the ash. </li>
    <li>Sampling results identifying backgound levels of the constituents of concern. </li>
    <li>A description of the character and extent of any soil or ground water contamination
      discovered during the site characterization study. </li>
    <li>A description of the geology and soils at the site. </li>
    <li>A description of the occurrence of surface water on and adjacent to the site and an
      estimate of the depth to ground water at the site. </li>
    <li>A description of all existing and proposed environmental monitoring, collection, and
      control systems for the site as required by the regulatory agencies. </li>
    <li>Information on the occurrence and character of ground water as required by the RWQCB.
      This information may include but not be limited to: <ul>
        <li>A description of the occurrence and character of ground water on and adjacent to the
          site. </li>
        <li>A detailed geologic map of the site with cross sections showing the relationships
          between the refuse/waste and geologic units and ground water levels. </li>
        <li>A conceptual hydrogeologic model for the site. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Excavation and Material Management</strong> </p>
  <p>Excavation and removal of solid waste may be considered a project under the California
  Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
  An
  environmental document or appropriate exemption under CEQA or NEPA may have to be secured
  and submitted as part of the clean closure plan prior to approval.&nbsp;All applicable
  federal, state, and local permits (e.g., grading permits, Fish &amp; Game approvals, OSHA
  reviews, etc.) should be obtained prior to any excavation. </p>
  <p>The owner/operator should supply the following information regarding the site and the
  proposed clean closure: <ul>
    <li>Identification of health and safety issues regarding the proposed site activities and a
      detailed protocol indicating what measures will be taken to ensure protection of the
      public health and safety and the environment. </li>
    <li>A plan to evaluate and dispose of any hazardous waste encountered during the clean
      closure operations. </li>
    <li>An excavation plan. </li>
    <li>A description of the sequence of excavation operations including the proposed removal
      rate and timeframe for the excavation operation. </li>
    <li>A description of the protocol to be followed in monitoring, collecting and controlling
      leachate, ground and surface water and landfill gas. </li>
    <li>A description of the proposed sampling and testing protocols for verification of clean
      closure. </li>
    <li>A description of the transport and fate and/or final disposition of the waste materials
      and residuals that will be excavated from the site. </li>
    <li>A drainage and winterization plan (when applicable). </li>
    <li>Any mitigation measures as called for in any necessary CEQA or NEPA document. </li>
    <li>Financial assurance for the project as necessary. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Confirmation of Refuse/Waste and Degraded Material Removal</strong> </p>
  <p>The following activities should be planned for and implemented: <ul>
    <li>Observation and documentation of removal of refuse/waste. </li>
    <li>Documentation verifying the final disposition of all refuse/waste materials. </li>
    <li>Adequate sampling must be performed after excavation to verify the removal of all waste
      materials and residuals, including interpretation of the test results by a qualified
      professional. </li>
    <li>Prepare and submit a map with a letter certifying that the constituents of concern
      concentration levels in the target media are either at or below the clean up limits
      established for the project. </li>
    <li>Submit a report documenting the activities which have occurred and verifying completion
      of clean closure to the appropriate regulatory agencies. </li>
    <li>Indicate on the site deed and/or title that the project was completed and where it was
      located. </li>
    <li>If the constituents of concern clean up level has not been met and further excavation is
      deemed not practical, develop and implement a remedial action plan for the site. </li>
    <li>If the site cannot be clean closed then closure and postclosure maintenance plans should
      be developed and submitted for review and approval, prior to implementation. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Postclosure Maintenance and Land Use</strong> </p>
  <p>One of the advantages of clean closing a solid waste disposal site is that a
  postclosure maintenance plan should not be needed if the entire site has been successfully
  clean closed. A description of the proposed postclosure land use should include: <ul>
    <li>The proposed postclosure land use for the site. </li>
    <li>If the clean closure was part of a remedial action, describe any postclosure maintenance
      activities needed to comply with the implementation of the remedial action plan. </li>
    <li>If the clean closure was not successful, a postclosure maintenance plan and a financial
      assurance mechanism for postclosure maintenance are needed and should be included with the
      verification report. </li>
  </ul>

<p>These guidelines are intended to provide useful direction for the clean closure of a
variety of site types and site conditions. In some instances, certain portions of
the information outlined above may not be applicable to a given site or the level of
detail necessary may vary due to site conditions. However, it is necessary for all
of the regulatory agencies involved to agree on what information is and is not necessary,
and the level of detail required, to allow the owner/operator to prepare the necessary
documents and to carry out a clean closure that can be approved by all of the agencies. </p>
