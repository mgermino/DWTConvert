    <strong>&nbsp;To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong>

<p>Two types of illegal disposal activities related to municipal solid wastes can commonly
be recognized. The first of these will be termed incidents of &quot;nuisance
dumping&quot; in this discussion. However, this type of illegal disposal activity may also
be known by other names such as promiscuous dumping, indiscriminate dumping, littering,
etc. The second type of illegal disposal activity is that involving illegal solid
waste disposal sites. </p>

<h2>What is Nuisance Dumping? </h2>

<p>Nuisance dumping is characterized by small volumes of solid waste materials discharged
to the ground surface. For example: a local resident arrives at the landfill
and finds the facility closed and locked. He then proceeds down the road and unloads
his pick-up full of trash by the side of the road. In general, cases of nuisance
dumping pose only a minor potential threat to public health and safety or the environment
compared to the potential threat posed by illegal solid waste disposal sites. However, cases of nuisance dumping which could pose a threat to public health and
safety or the environment should be dealt with in a timely and appropriate fashion.
Sites which pose a threat to ground or surface water quality should be reported to
the appropriate Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). </p>

<h2>What is the Appropriate Action for Incidents of Nuisance Dumping? </h2>

<p>Enforcement actions against the owner or tenant of any premises, business establishment
or industry for incidents of nuisance dumping may be dealt with under California Code of
Regulations (CCR), Title 14, Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 5, Section 17331. In
addition, local codes or ordinances or the State Penal Code (Section 374 <i>et seq.</i>)
may be available to deal with incidents of nuisance dumping. The local district
attorney should be contacted to determine the appropriateness and applicability of
prosecution under the State Penal Code in such incidents. </p>

<h2>What are Illegal Solid Waste Disposal Sites? </h2>

<p>Illegal solid waste disposal sites are those which, due to magnitude, obvious intent,
or evidence of past or current burning of waste, may present a more significant potential
threat to public health and safety and the environment than incidents of nuisance dumping
as described above. </p>

<p>An illegal solid waste disposal site may be characterized by the following criteria: 

<ol>
  <li>The presence of large volumes of waste, </li>
  <li>Evidence of repeated dumping, </li>
  <li>Evidence of buried waste, </li>
  <li>The presence of excavations for waste disposal, </li>
  <li>Evidence of periodic and/or current burning of waste, and/or </li>
  <li>The presence of equipment or personnel on-site. </li>
</ol>

<p>Any one, or a combination of the listed characteristics, may indicate that a site is an
illegal solid waste disposal site. In some cases, the distinction between nuisance
dumping and an illegal solid waste disposal site may be difficult.&nbsp;However, the
determination that a site is an illegal solid waste disposal site involves more regulatory
agencies and requirements in the process to assure that public health and safety and the
environment are protected. The Site Investigation Process (SIP) guidelines for
investigating closed, illegal, and abandoned solid waste disposal sites (see CIWMB LEA
<a href="../junk/03/default.htm">
Advisory No. 3</a>, June 1993) can be used as a starting point in classifying such sites.
These guidelines present a more structured approach to the problem of classifying
and ranking closed, illegal, and abandoned sites and also outline a means by which the
frequency of inspection by the LEA can be reduced if appropriate. If you have any
questions about the process, or questions about the classification of particular sites,
the staff of the Closure and Remediation Branch of the Board can be contacted for
assistance. </p>

<h2>What is the Appropriate Action for Illegal Solid Waste Disposal Sites? </h2>

<p>The responsible party for an illegal disposal site has two options: 

<ol>
  <li>Comply with all of the applicable regulations and obtain a permit to operate as a solid
    waste facility, or </li>
  <li>Close the site under the applicable regulations. </li>
</ol>

<p>The closure of illegal solid waste disposal sites which accepted waste after January 1,
1988, fall under 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 7.8 and Chapter 5, Articles 3.4
and 3.5. Submittal and review of the closure plans for these sites would follow the
procedures outlined in 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 5, Article 3.4.&nbsp;If the site has
not received waste after January 1, 1988, but did not close under the regulations
applicable at the time waste acceptance ceased, it falls under 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter
3, Article 7.8. In this case, the position of coordinating agency for the review and the
timeline for the submittal and review of closure plans and other documents by the various
agencies should be agreed upon by the agencies at the beginning of the project. For
pre-1988 sites, the regulatory agencies may collectively determine that only some portions
of 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 7.8 need be applied to a particular site based
on site conditions, history, and land-use. If the responsible party chooses to clean
close the site as an alternative to a more conventional closure (closure with waste in
place), a determination that clean closure is appropriate for that site would need to be
made by the Board, RWQCB, and the LEA. Guidelines for clean closure can be found in LEA
Advisory 16. Regardless of the date waste was last accepted, should the site pose a
threat to public health and safety or the environment, or be a significant nuisance, then
the applicable sections of the minimum standards (14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 3, Articles
4.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, and 7.8) should be applied. In this circumstance,
the authority to apply these standards would be the general statutory language contained
in Sections 43501, 44001, 44002, 45200, and 45300 of the Public Resources Code, as
appropriate. There may also be local ordinances that apply. </p>

<h2>Illegal Solid Waste Disposal Sites with no Responsible Party or Recalcitrant
Responsible Parties </h2>

<p>Beginning January 1, 1994, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) has
implemented a new cleanup program. The Solid Waste Disposal and Codisposal Site
Cleanup Program (AB 2136) allows the Board to finance the cleanup of solid waste disposal
and codisposal sites. The Board may expend a portion of the fund on the cleanup of
illegal solid waste disposal sites. &nbsp;AB 2136 targets sites where the responsible
party cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to pay for timely remediation.
To qualify for funding, the sites must pose a threat to public health and safety or
the environment. Under the AB 2136 program the Board can finance, through loans and
grants, a wide range of cleanup projects. The Board may expend funds directly for
cleanup or emergency actions, provide loans to responsible parties who demonstrate the
ability to repay state funds, provide grants to LEAs for the clean up of illegal solid
waste disposal sites, or provide matching grants to local governments to assist in site
cleanup.&nbsp;All of the cleanups will have certain criteria applied to prevent a
recurrence of the problems and will be coordinated with the LEAs. </p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide
guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties.
Guidance, for this purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s
regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a>
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">11342.6</a>).
Advisories do not take precedence over statute or regulation.</p>
