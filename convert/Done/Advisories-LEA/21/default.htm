    <strong>&nbsp;To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong>

<p>Statute and Regulation require that Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) review each Solid Waste
Facility Permit at least once every five years from the date of issuance. The Permit Desk Manual
(rescinded in 1998 and replaced by the <a href="/SWFacilities/Permitting/">Permit
Toolbox</a> in 2001) provided guidance to LEAs on how to conduct permit reviews.&nbsp;However, the majority of that guidance was given in the form of questions that LEAs
should keep in mind during the review process. With regard to the preparation of the
Permit Review Report, the Permit Desk Manual did not provide a recommended format or a
standardized form for use by LEAs. As a result, Permit Review Reports submitted by LEAs
have varied widely in form and content. </p>

<p>From a practical standpoint, an LEA conducts a permit review every time a change in the
design or operation of the facility occurs or is proposed. However, the result of
that review is rarely documented in a Permit Review Report unless the facility is due for
a five year review. The purpose of this advisory is to provide LEAs with a
recommended format that will allow quick and easy documentation of the permit review
process. </p>

<p class="ListIntro">In addition to a title or subject line identifying the submitted document as a Permit
Review Report for a specific facility, there are four key components to a complete Permit
Review Report: 

<ol>
  <li>A List of the Documents Reviewed </li>
  <li>A List of Findings Made (including page references) </li>
  <li>A List of Conclusions Reached Regarding Permit Status and the need for
    Revision/Suspension/Revocation of the Permit </li>
  <li>A List of the Directives Given to the Operator </li>
</ol>

<p>Also see the <a href="/SWFacilities/Permitting/CheckItems/PermitReview/default.htm#Conclusion">Conclusions
and Directives Chart</a> in the Permit Toolbox.

<p class="ListIntro">In other words, to be complete, a Permit Review Report should answer these questions:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>What did you look at? </li>
  <li>What did you find? </li>
  <li>What did you conclude? </li>
  <li>What did you tell the operator to do? </li>
</ul>

is provided as an example. At this time, use of the form 
is highly recommended, but not required. </p>

<p><strong>Publication #232-95-003</strong></p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide
guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties.
Guidance, for this purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s
regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a>
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">11342.6</a>).
Advisories do not take precedence over statute or regulation.</p>
