<h2>CCR �15162 - Subsequent EIR and Negative Declaration </h2>

<p><i>(a) &nbsp;When an EIR has been certified or a Negative Declaration adopted, no
subsequent EIR shall be prepared for that project unless the lead agency determines, on
the basis of substantial evidence in light of the whole record, one or more of the
following:</i> </p>

<p><i>(1) &nbsp;Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major
revisions of</i> <i>the EIR or Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new
significant environmental</i> <i>effects or a substantial increase in severity of
previously identified significant</i> <i>effects;</i> </p>

<p><i>(2) &nbsp;Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which
the project</i> <i>is being undertaken which will require major revisions of the EIR or
Negative Declaration</i> <i>due to involvement of new significant environmental effects or
a substantial increase in</i> <i>severity of previously identified significant effects; or</i>
</p>

<p><i>(3) &nbsp;New information of substantial importance which was not known could not
have been</i> <i>known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous
EIR was</i> <i>certified or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows the following:</i>
</p>

<p><i>(A) &nbsp;The project will have one or more significant effects</i> <i>not discussed
in the previous EIR or Negative Declaration.</i> </p>

<p><i>(B) &nbsp;Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe
than</i> <i>previously shown in the previous EIR.</i> </p>

<p><i>(C) &nbsp;Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible
would in</i> <i>fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant
effects of the</i> <i>project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation
measure or</i> <i>alternative; or</i> </p>

<p><i>(D) &nbsp;Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from
those</i> <i>analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more
significant effects</i> <i>on the environment, but the project proponent decline to adopt
the mitigation measure or</i> <i>alternative.</i> </p>

<p><i>(b) &nbsp;If changes to a project or its circumstances occur or new information
becomes</i> <i>available after adoption of a negative declaration, the lead agency shall
prepare a</i> <i>subsequent EIR if required under subsection (a). Otherwise the lead
agency shall</i> <i>determine whether to prepare a subsequent negative declaration, an
addendum, or no</i> <i>further documentation.</i> </p>

<p><i>(c) &nbsp;If a project was approved prior to the occurrence of the conditions
described in the</i> <i>subsection (a), the subsequent EIR or Negative Declaration shall
be prepared by the</i> <i>Public Agency which grants the next discretionary approval for
the project. In this</i> <i>situation no other Responsible Agency shall grant an
approval for the project until the</i> <i>subsequent EIR has been certified or subsequent
Negative Declaration adopted.</i> </p>

<p><i>(d) &nbsp;A subsequent EIR or subsequent Negative Declaration shall be given the
same notice and public review as required under Section 15087 or Section 15072.&nbsp;A
subsequent EIR or</i> <i>Negative Declaration shall state where the previous document is
available and can be</i> <i>reviewed.</i> </p>

<h2><strong><a NAME="CCR">CCR �15164<i> -</i> Addendum to an EIR or Negative Declaration</a></strong>
</h2>

<p><i>(a) &nbsp;The lead agency or responsible agency shall prepare an addendum to a
previously</i> <i>certified EIR if some changes or additions are necessary but none of the
conditions</i> <i>described in Section 15162 calling for preparation of a subsequent EIR
have occurred.</i> </p>

<p><i>(b) &nbsp;An addendum to an adopted negative declaration may be prepared if only
minor</i> <i>technical changes or additions are necessary.</i> </p>

<p><i>(c) &nbsp;An addendum need not be circulated for public review but can be included
in or</i> <i>attached to the final EIR or adopted negative declaration.</i> </p>

<p><i>(d) &nbsp;The decision-making body shall consider the addendum with the final EIR or
adopted</i> <i>negative declaration prior to making a decision on the project.</i> </p>

<p><i>(e) &nbsp;A brief explanation of the decision not to prepare a subsequent EIR
pursuant to</i> <i>Section 15162 should be included in an addendum to an EIR, the lead
agency's required</i> <i>findings on the project, or elsewhere in the record. The
explanation must be supported</i> <i>by substantial evidence.</i> </p>
