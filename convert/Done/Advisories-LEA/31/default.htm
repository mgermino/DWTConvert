    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this advisory is to clarify the intent of the advisories issued by the
CIWMB and to indicate which advisories are no longer in effect or which require revision. </p>

<p><strong>Intent of the Advisories</strong> </p>

<p>The intent of the advisories is to provide guidance to the LEAs in performing their
duties. Guidance, for this purpose, was defined as providing explanation of the Board's
regulations and statutes, and recommendations on how an LEA might satisfy program goals
and objectives. </p>

<p>It is the Board's responsibility to provide training, technical assistance, and
guidance to the LEAs (PRC �43217) and the Advisories are one way in which the Board
delivers this assistance. The advisories were never intended to impose substantive
requirements on LEAs. </p>

<p><strong>Are the Advisories Enforceable?</strong> </p>

<p>Advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as regulations because they have not
been adopted through the formal rulemaking process. Thus, operators can not be cited
for not following the guidance provided in an Advisory. Likewise, in no instance
does it state within an Advisory that an LEA is required to follow the guidance.
The
Board will not take action against an LEA for not following guidance provided in the
Advisories. This includes Advisories which were approved as Board policy. </p>

<p>During the LEA evaluation process, Board staff recommended that the Advisories be
included in the LEA's Enforcement Program Plan (EPP). In those instances, inclusion
of the Advisories was intended to provide guidance for issues which the LEA has either not
included in the EPP, or to reinforce the information already provided in the EPP.
The LEA is not required to include Advisories in the EPP, especially if the LEA has
in place superior procedures than those suggested in an Advisory. However, if an LEA
has chosen to follow an approach different from the suggested Advisory guidance which is
not effective at resolving an issue, the LEA should be prepared to articulate their
reasoning for implementing their approach during the LEA evaluation process. </p>

<h2><strong>Advisory Update</strong> </h2>

<p>Review of the Advisories also revealed the need to update several which are no longer
in effect either due to the promulgation of new regulations or conflicts with changes in
existing regulation. The changes are as follows: </p>

	<h3>Advisory #1, Asbestos Containing Waste Disposal </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Informs LEAs of agencies' (CIWMB, DTSC, LEA) responsibilities for asbestos disposal as
  described in an MOU with DTSC. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: A new MOU has been signed by the CIWMB and DTSC but has not been
  re-issued as an advisory. This Advisory will be revised. In the meantime contact
  your Enforcement Branch representative for issues concerning asbestos containing waste. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #4, Permitting of Fuel Contaminated Soils Treatment/Processing Facilities 
	</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The guidance recommends LEAs delay acceptance of permit applications for the described
  facilities until they have been considered for slotting within the tiered permitting
  structure. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Regulations for the permitting of these facilities became
  effective April 24, 1996. This Advisory is no longer applicable guidance and can be
  removed from LEA reference files. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #12 Permitting of Non-Traditional Facilities </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Advisory recommends that LEAs not accept applications for solid waste facility
  permits for the operation of &quot;non-traditional facilities&quot;. &nbsp;It also lists
  examples of non-traditional facilities. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: The original Advisory only addressed the operation of
  non-traditional <i>facilities</i>. Certain waste handling activities have and will be
  classified as &quot;operations&quot;. This Advisory will be revised to encompass
  operations as well as facilities. Additionally, &quot;contaminated soils
  remediation&quot; should be removed from the example list as these activities have been
  slotted. Please contact your Permits Branch staff contact if you have any questions
  in the interim. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #14 Revised Policy and Procedures for Maintaining the Inventory of Solid
Waste Facilities Which Violate State Minimum Standards </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The policy for the Inventory process came under scrutiny during a legal challenge
  brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: A letter was sent to all LEAs dated April 5, 1996 which states
  that Advisory #14 is no longer in effect. Please refer to this letter and the
  Inventory Implementation handout which was distributed at the May 1996 Roundtables until
  further notice regarding implementation of the Inventory process. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #18 Permitting and Enforcement at Composting Facilities </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Advisory provides guidance for oversight of composting facilities until they are
  slotted in the tiered permitting structure. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: The tiered permitting structure is now in effect, therefore this
  Advisory is no longer applicable guidance and can be removed from LEA reference files. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #19 (Revised) Approval of Alternative Daily Cover Demonstration Projects
Using Green Material and Other Waste Derived Materials </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The approval process, if followed, allows LEA discretionary approval for the described
  projects. This Advisory also makes mention of the allowance of green waste, when
  used as ADC, to count as diversion for purposes of meeting AB 939. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: A recent court decision has invalidated the use of ADC as
  diversion. That decision is currently on appeal. In the interim, this Advisory
  is still valid but may need to undergo another revision if this decision is upheld. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #27 Permitting Action for Inactive Landfills </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Advisory indicates a permit is required to reflect closure prior to the completion
  of closure activities. AB 59 has since passed, and provides that the
  Closure/Postclosure Maintenance Plan may stand as the enforceable document. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>: This Advisory is being revised. Please call your Permits
  Branch staff contact if you have any questions. </p>
</blockquote>

	<h3>Advisory #28 Prevent or Substantially Impair Policy for Solid Waste Facilities During
the Gap Period </h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Advisory provides direction on the LEA's role in providing &quot;prevent or
  substantially impair&quot; information to the Board when a permit is processed. </p>
  <p><strong>Update</strong>:&nbsp;Public Resources Code section 44009 was amended with the passage
  of AB 2009 which removed the requirement that the Board determine if issuance of a permit
  would &quot;prevent or substantially impair&quot; achievement of waste diversion goals.
  This Advisory is no longer applicable and can be removed from LEA reference files. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Future Advisories </h2>

<p>All future advisories will include a statement to reflect their nonenforceability, that
the advisories do not take precedence over statute or regulation. Additionally,
staff will periodically review the issued Advisories to determine if any updates are in
order to keep the Advisories current and will provide the this information to the LEAs. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>
