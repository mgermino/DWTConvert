    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong></p>

<p>Due to the recent increase in landfill closures, refuse formerly disposed in landfills
located near the source of generation is now being transported to more distant facilities,
including out of state. It has come to the attention of CIWMB staff that some California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents prepared for this type of project may not
address or may fail to adequately address potential cumulative impacts from such an
action. </p>

<p>CIWMB staff would like to bring to your attention the requirements of CEQA with respect
to cumulative impact analyses. We encourage LEAs, when consulting with lead agencies
or commenting on documents, to inform the lead agency of any similar projects or projects
with related impacts that may need to be evaluated in a cumulative impact analysis. </p>

<p>Although a lead agency may find that a specific impact is less than significant within
the scope of its jurisdictional analysis, the same action on a regional scale may
contribute to or create a significant cumulative effect. For example, the additional
truck traffic from a proposed project which would not significantly impact a particular
length of highway when considered by itself could create a substantial cumulative impact
when combined with traffic from other projected or reasonably anticipated sources. </p>

<p>Court interpretations of CEQA have further defined CEQA's statutory provisions.&nbsp;For example, a cumulative impact discussion may be found inadequate if it does not
include the elements listed in CEQA Guidelines Section 15130 (Cumulative Impacts);
specifically, either a list of closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
future projects, or a summary of projections contained in an adopted planning document
which is designed to evaluate regional or area-wide conditions. This section further
requires that the analysis include a discussion of projects under review by the lead
agency and projects under review by other relevant public agencies, using reasonable
efforts to discover, disclose, and discuss other related projects. </p>

<p>LEAs are the best source of information about similar projects which should be included
in an analysis of cumulative impacts.&nbsp;When consulting with a lead agency please
share information on solid waste projects which may reasonably have the potential to
create or to exacerbate environmental impacts associated with the proposed project.
When acting as lead agency, please coordinate with other sources such as
governmental agencies, concerned citizens and organizations, or consultants for assistance
in identifying issues or activities which may affect or be affected by the proposed
project. CEQA Guidelines and CIWMB staff encourage early consultation as a means to avert
potential problems, delays, or controversy early in the review process. </p>

<p>Please contact 
<a href="/StaffDirectory/Employee/731/">Sue O'Leary</a> of my staff if you have any questions
regarding this issue. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide guidance to 
Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties. Guidance, for this 
purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s regulations and 
statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement 
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as 
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking 
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">
11340.5</a>
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">
11342.6</a>). Advisories do not take precedence over statute or regulation.</p><a href="../"><strong>Advisories Home</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>|
