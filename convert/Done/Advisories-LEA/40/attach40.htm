litter, and scavenging without presenting a threat to human health and the environment. </p>

<p>(c) The board may grant a temporary waiver from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this section if the owner or operator demonstrates that there are extreme seasonal
climatic conditions that make meeting such requirements impractical. </p>
