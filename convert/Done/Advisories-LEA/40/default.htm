    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies: </strong>

<p>The purpose of this LEA Advisory is to provide guidance on the issuance of daily cover
waivers allowed under Title 14, California Code of Regulations (14 CCR), Division 7,
Chapter 3, Article 4.5, Section 17258.21(c), Cover Material Requirements. &nbsp;This
section is being recodified under Title 27, California Code of Regulations (27 CCR),
Division 2, Subdivision 1, Chapter 3, Subchapter 4, Article 2, Section 20680(b), CIWMB -
Daily Cover and will be effective July 18, 1997. &nbsp;In addition this section (27 CCR
20680[b]) is being revised as part of the alternative daily cover (ADC) regulation
process. A copy of the old, the recodified, and the proposed regulations are
included as <a HREF="attach40.htm">Attachment A</a>. (Please note that the attached
regulations are an unofficial version of the regulations. The authoritative regulations
are found in Barclays Official California Code of Regulations published by Barclays Law
Publishers.) </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>On October 9, 1991, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the
final rule for the Criteria for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and
Practices (Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations [40 CFR], part 258). These rules,
effective October 9, 1993, were developed in response to the 1984 Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and are commonly
referred to as RCRA Subtitle D (or Subtitle D, for short). </p>

<p>As part of the effort to become an &quot;Approved State&quot; under RCRA Subtitle D,
various sections of Subtitle D were added to the California Integrated Waste Management
Board's (Board) State Minimum Standards on July 12, 1993. Included in these regulations
was 14 CCR 17258.21 which specified requirements for daily cover, allowed for alternative
daily cover materials, and allowed for the waiver of daily cover requirements under
specified conditions. This language has been moved to 27 CCR 20680(b) as part of the
revisions made to the Board's regulations pursuant to AB 1220 (Chapter 656, Statutes of
1993). </p>

<h2>What Is a Daily Cover Waiver?</h2>

<p>The regulations require that landfill operators cover disposed waste with six (6)
inches of earthen material (or an approved alternative material of alternative thickness)
at the end of each operating day or at more frequent intervals if necessary to control
disease vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging. A daily cover waiver is a
waiver issued by the Board (issuance has been delegated to the Deputy Director, Permitting
and Enforcement Division), jointly with the Enforcement Agency, which grants a temporary
reprieve from the requirements of placing daily cover (or alternative daily cover).
(Please note that should the draft ADC regulations be approved as currently proposed, the
daily cover waiver will then be issued by the EA with concurrence by the Deputy Director,
Permitting and Enforcement Division.) </p>

<h2>When May a Daily Cover Waiver Be Issued?</h2>

<p>A daily cover waiver may be issued if a landfill owner or operator demonstrates that
there are extreme seasonal climatic conditions that make meeting the daily cover
requirements impractical. Please note that, unlike the emergency waiver of standards, a
proclamation of a state of emergency or local emergency is not required for the issuance
of a daily cover waiver. While the regulation does not specify what is meant by
&quot;extreme seasonal climatic conditions,&quot; EPA has provided guidance in both the Appendices to the Preamble to the Subtitle D Regulations (Attachment
B; not available on line)and in a guidance manual, <i>Solid Waste Disposal Facility
Criteria - A Technical Manual</i> (Attachment C; not available on line). </p>

<p>During the development of the federal Subtitle D regulations, EPA considered requests
to also allow a waiver of daily cover requirements due to the types and quantities of
waste received, the location of the facility, the facility design and operation, and the
practicable capability of the operator. EPA rejected these considerations because daily
cover is a necessary good housekeeping practice and should be required regardless of waste
types, location of the facility, and the design and operation of the facility. Unlike
extreme seasonal climatic conditions, which make placement of daily cover very difficult,
the other considered conditions do not pose significant obstacles to daily cover
operations. Furthermore, EPA concluded that the protection provided to public health and
safety and the environment by daily cover outweighs any of the difficulties posed by the
other considerations. </p>

<p>Activities that may be affected by extreme seasonal climatic conditions include:
obtaining cover soil from a borrow pit; transporting cover soil to the working face; and
spreading and compacting the soil to achieve the required functions. Extremely cold
conditions (i.e., frozen soil) may prevent efficient excavation of soil from a borrow pit
or the spreading and compaction of the soil on the waste. Extremely wet conditions (e.g.,
flooding) may prevent transporting cover soil to the working face and may make it
impractical to excavate or spread and compact. </p>

<p>As can be discerned from the guidance, the intent of the daily cover waiver is to only
grant the waiver when extreme seasonal climatic conditions directly affect (1) the daily
cover material by making it unavailable (e.g., frozen) or unspreadable (e.g., too fluid)
or (2) the ability to transport the daily cover material (e.g., flooded or impassable
access roads). This waiver should not be encouraged nor normally be granted for rain
conditions, even above-average rain conditions. Operators should employ measures to
prepare for the rainy season, including preparation of a wet weather area, stockpiling of
cover material, and proper drainage controls. A lack of proper winterization procedures
and measures should not produce a daily cover waiver. </p>

<h2>How Long Does a Waiver Remain In Effect?</h2>

<p>There is no specific minimum or maximum timeline specified in the regulations.
Therefore, depending on the reason(s) for the daily cover waiver, the waiver may be as
short as one day for unusual rain storms or as long as several months for extreme seasonal
climatic conditions. However, the waiver should be granted for the shortest period of time
absolutely necessary to provide for the greatest protection of public health and safety
and the environment. Moreover, the operator should take all appropriate actions to
alleviate the conditions which necessitated the waiver. </p>

<p>For example, should a waiver be granted because a borrow pit was flooded due to extreme
rainfall/flood conditions, the operator should pump out the standing water in the pit and
not wait for the water in the pit to naturally percolate and/or evaporate. Likewise,
should an access road be damaged, the road should be repaired as soon as possible. Also,
alternative daily cover (ADC) materials could be considered while the waiver was in effect
if conventional earthen materials will not be accessible for a significant period of time.
However, the use of ADC materials must comply with current ADC approval processes. </p>

<h2>How Is a Daily Cover Waiver Issued?</h2>

<p>There are no specific procedures specified in the regulation for requesting and/or
granting a daily cover waiver. However, the process of obtaining a waiver should follow
the generalized protocol for obtaining other waivers from Subtitle D requirements. The
operator would contact (in writing, probably by fax due to the time restraint of the
request) the EA who would make the initial assessment. The initial assessment should
consist of a site visit to verify the conditions which necessitated the operator's
request. Should a site visit be impractical, the EA should attempt to verify the
information provided by the operator by other available means including phone calls and
information gathering from other agency personnel. If the EA concurs with the operator's
request, a brief letter from the EA transmitting the request and a description of the
problem would be submitted to the Board's Enforcement Branch in the Permitting and
Enforcement Division. Upon concurrence by the Deputy Director, Permitting and Enforcement
Division, the waiver would be granted jointly by the Board and EA (or by the EA only
should the regulation be modified as currently proposed). The approval would contain a
specified time period for which the waiver is granted and a date after which daily cover
must again be applied. </p>

<p>Board staff are available for consultation and assistance when reviewing operators'
requests for waivers. General questions on the issuance of daily cover waivers should be
directed to the Permitting and Enforcement Division Disaster Coordinator (Michael B.
Wochnick) at (916) 341-6318. Site specific concerns should be discussed with the
appropriate Enforcement Branch contact. </p>

<h2>What Are the Reporting Requirements?</h2>

<p>There are no specific reporting requirements contained in the regulations. However, the
operator should maintain records of the day(s) daily cover was not applied and the efforts
taken to alleviate the condition(s) that led to the issuance of the waiver. </p>

<p>Should you have any questions or comments concerning this advisory, please contact
<a href="/StaffDirectory/Employee/287/">Michael Wochnick</a> of my staff. </p>
