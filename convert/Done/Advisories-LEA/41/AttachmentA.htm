    <h2>Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Division 7, Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Section 17210 <i>Scope and Applicability</i></strong> </p>

<p>(a) This article informs an operator, who holds a valid solid waste facilities
permit, of the process for applying for an emergency waiver of standards (waiver) in the
event of a state of emergency or local emergency. The waiver grants an operator
temporary relief from specific standards imposed by this Division or specific terms or
conditions of a solid waste facilities permit issued pursuant to this Division.&nbsp;This
Article implements and makes specific those provisions of Section 43035 of the Public
Resources Code relating to the integrated waste management disaster plan. </p>

<p>(b) This Article is not intended to limit the authority of the state or a local
agency during a disaster or emergency. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Authority cited: Sections 40502 and 43035, Public Resources
Code. </p>

<p><strong>Reverence</strong>: Sections 40001, 40002, 40051, 40052, 40053, 40054, 40055,
40056, 40057, 43020, and 43021, Public Resources Code. </p>

<p><strong>Section 17210.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Definitions</i></strong> </p>

<p>(a) &quot;Agency&quot; means the local agency responsible for compiling the
disposal information from haulers and operators. The county is the agency, unless a
region is given the responsibility as part of a regional agreement. </p>

<p>(b) &quot;Board&quot; means the California Integrated Waste Management Board. </p>

<p>(c) &quot;Disaster&quot; means a natural catastrophe such as an earthquake, fire,
flood, landslide, or volcanic eruption, or, regardless of cause, any explosion, fire, or
flood. </p>

<p>(d) &quot;Disaster Debris&quot; means nonhazardous solid waste caused by or
directly related to a disaster. </p>

<p>(e) &quot;Diversion&quot; means the directing of solid waste from disposal or
transformation by means of recycling, reuse, or composting. </p>

<p>(f) &quot;Emergency Waiver of Standards&quot; means the document signifying
approval by an enforcement agency which allows an operator, who holds a valid solid waste
facilities permit, the ability to deviate from specified state minimum solid waste
standards or terms or conditions of a solid waste facilities permit issued pursuant to
this Division. The waiver applies to the origin of waste; the rate of inflow for
storage, transfer, or disposal of waste; the type and moisture content of solid waste; the
hours of facility operation; and the storage time before transfer or disposal of wastes,
at a solid waste facility. This includes the establishment of a locally-approved
temporary transfer or processing site, if authorized by the enforcement agency. </p>

<p>(g) &quot;Enforcement Agency&quot; means the agency designated pursuant to the
requirements set forth in Public Resources Code, sections 43200 through 43221, or the
Executive Director of the Board in the event that the enforcement agency (EA) is incapable
of responding due to the nature of the emergency. </p>

<p>(h) &quot;Extent Feasible&quot; is evidenced by the use of maximum efforts to
recycle, reuse, or otherwise divert from disposal as much of the debris and other
nonhazardous waste received by the solid waste facility as possible, as determined by the
operator. </p>

<p>(i) &quot;Jurisdiction of Origin&quot; means the incorporated city or the
unincorporated area of the county where the waste originated. </p>

<p>(j) &nbsp;&quot;Local Emergency&quot; means the duly proclaimed existence of conditions
of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the
territorial limits of a county, city and county, or city, as described in Government Code
section 8558(c), which conditions are or are likely to be beyond the control of the
services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of that political subdivision and require
the combined forces of other political subdivisions to combat, as stated in the
proclamation by the governing body of a county, city and county, or city, or by an
official so designated by ordinance adopted by such governing body to issue such
proclamation. </p>

<p>(k) &quot;State of Emergency&quot; means the duly proclaimed existence of
conditions of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within
the state, as described in Government Code section 8558(b), which conditions, by reason of
their magnitude, are or are likely to be beyond the control of the services, personnel,
equipment, and facilities of any single county, city and county, or city, and require the
combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat, as stated in a proclamation
by the Governor. </p>

<p><strong>Section 17210.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Purpose and Limitation of Emergency Waiver</i></strong> </p>

a state of emergency or local emergency, as those terms are defined in this Article. </p>

<p>(b) An EA may approve and issue a waiver for the express purpose of enabling an
operator of an existing permitted solid waste facility or a locally-approved temporary
transfer or processing site to accept disaster debris and other nonhazardous wastes, in a
manner not consistent with the terms and conditions of the relevant solid waste facilities
permit, during the recovery phase of a state of emergency or local emergency. </p>

<p>(c) The waiver may apply to specified state minimum solid waste standards or a
specific term or condition of a solid waste facilities permit at an existing solid waste
facility or a locally-approved temporary transfer or processing site which are related to
the following: the origin of waste; the rate of inflow for storage, transfer, processing,
or disposal of waste; the type and moisture content of solid waste; the hours of facility
operation; and the storage time before transfer, processing, or disposal of nonhazardous
waste. </p>

<p>(d) The effective period of an initial waiver, once granted by the EA, shall not
exceed 120 days. Upon receipt of the reports required in section 17210.5, the EA may
extend the effective period of a waiver, as necessary, to assist in the recovery from an
emergency. </p>

<p>(e) All other state minimum standards and permit conditions which are not the
subject of the waiver shall remain in effect. </p>

<p>(f) A waiver may be modified, canceled, or revoked by the EA without advance
notice should the EA determine that any of the following occurs: </p>

<p>(1) The use of such a waiver will cause or contribute to a public health and
safety or environmental problem; </p>

<p>(2) The terms of the waiver are not being used expressly to handle the state of
emergency or local emergency and are not in the best interest of the public health and
safety; </p>

<p>(3) The waiver is no longer necessary; </p>

<p>(4) The solid waste facility operator is not utilizing disaster debris diversion
programs to the extent feasible. </p>

<p><strong>Section 17210.3 <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; Request for an Emergency Waiver</i></strong> </p>

<p>(a) An operator may apply to an EA for a waiver after a disaster or emergency
situation as defined in this Article, has been declared. The waiver shall only be
granted with the express approval of the EA following a proclamation of emergency or
declaration of disaster at the local or state levels. </p>

<p>(b) To obtain a waiver, a solid waste facility operator shall submit a written
request to the EA. The request for a waiver shall include, but not be limited to, the
following information: </p>

<p>(1) A listing of the existing solid waste facilities permit terms and conditions
to be waived in order to facilitate recovery and disposal of disaster debris in the event
of a declared disaster or emergency; </p>

<p>(2) A statement of the remaining disposal capacity of the solid waste disposal
facility at the time of the request; </p>

<p>(3) A description of all facility-related diversion programs and on-site
recycling facilities; and </p>

environment; </p>

<p>(3) The operator identifies and implements, to the extent feasible, diversion
programs to maximize diversion through reuse, recycling, or composting of disaster-related
waste. </p>

<p>(b) Within 7 days of receipt of the solid waste facility operator's request for a
waiver, the EA shall notify the solid waste facility operator in writing whether or not
the request for waiver has been granted. If the proposed waiver is not granted, the
EA's notification shall contain reasons for the denial. The solid waste facility
operator may reapply for the waiver at a later date or submit necessary documentation to
receive the waiver immediately. </p>
