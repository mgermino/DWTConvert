    <h2>Purpose and Scope of this Advisory </h2>

<p>This advisory replaces LEA Advisory No. 1, issued October 6, 1992. It is intended for
use by Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) impacted by Chapter 3.5 of the California Code of
Regulations (CCR). This advisory will focus on Articles 1 and 5 of Chapter 3.5 CCR, since
Articles 2-4 are directed at operator performance requirements. </p>

	<h2>Background of the Asbestos Containing Waste Regulations&nbsp; </h2>

<p>Asbestos, a carcinogen is considered a hazardous material when disposed in waste that
contains greater than 1 percent friable asbestos. Asbestos containing waste (ACW)
materials has historically been deposited at solid waste disposal sites. Prior to 1994,
the authority to regulate friable ACW rested solely with the Department of Toxic
Substances Control (DTSC). </p>

<p>The passage of Chapter 1227, Statutes of 1994 (AB 688, Sher) gave the Board the
responsibility of regulating asbestos containing waste, as defined in Section 25143.7 of
the Health and Safety Code, at solid waste facilities that fall under its regulatory
purview (which excludes asbestos monofills). Furthermore, Section 44820 of the Public
Resources Code (PRC) specifically mandated the Board to develop regulations creating an
inspection, permitting, and enforcement program for the disposal of ACW. State law also
required the Board to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DTSC delineating
the enforcement duties of the Board and DTSC. In compliance with the above legislative
mandates, the Board carried out the following: 

<ul>
  <li>Signed an MOU with DTSC on May 18, 1995. </li>
  <li>Adopted emergency ACW regulations on August 1, 1996. </li>
  <li>Established permanent ACW regulations on January 13, 1997.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p>The Board decided to develop the ACW regulations relying on the use of performance
standards rather than prescriptive ones. Consequently, not every implementation aspect
associated with LEA standards and authorization was spelled out as regulatory text. This
was done with the knowledge that implementation issues arising from this regulatory
language would not only require close Board/LEA interaction, but would also allow for LEA
flexibility in meeting established ACW requirements. </p>

	<h2>Overview of the ACW Regulations </h2>

<p><a href="guidefor.doc">A Guide to Standards for the Handling and Disposal
of Asbestos Containing Waste at Solid Waste Disposal Sites (Attachment 1)</a>  (Word
6.0, 180 KB) explains the ACW regulations in easy-to-read layman's terms along with
the regulatory text. The regulations consist of the following five articles:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>Article 1 discusses the general provisions related to the purpose, scope and
    applicability aspects of the ACW regulations. It also deals with compliance schedules
    applicable to non-hazardous disposal sites regulated by the Board. </li>
  <li>Article 2 focuses on general standards for the designated ACW disposal area with regard
    to location, design, construction, operation, and maintenance. </li>
  <li>Article 3 outlines the requirements for excavation of buried ACW. </li>
  <li>Article 4 reminds the owner/operator that ACW disposal sites must meet specific
    requirements for closure and post-closure as required for other solid waste landfills. </li>
  <li>Article 5 contains the requirements LEAs must satisfy before being authorized to enforce
    the ACW regulations. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="acwinspe.xls">Attachment 2 is the Field Data Collection Checklist</a>
 (Excel 5.0, 27 KB)
that corresponds with articles 2-4. </p>

	<h2>Questions and Answers About the ACW Regulations&nbsp; </h2>

<p>Below are questions and answers received to date regarding the ACW authorization
program. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;To who do the LEA standards and authorization apply?&nbsp;</i> </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;The LEA standards and authorization requirements only apply to LEAs having
non-hazardous waste disposal facilities and unclassified waste management units which have
Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) that provide for the disposal of friable ACW. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;To who do LEA standards and authorization requirements not apply?</i> </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;The LEA standards and authorization requirements do not apply to LEAs who opt
to not request authorization, or have no non-hazardous waste disposal facilities or
unclassified waste management units which dispose of friable ACW within their
jurisdictions. Nor do they apply to those LEAs having friable ACW monofills which are
located at solid waste facilities not regulated by the Board (Class I disposal sites) or
illegal dumping. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;Do LEA standards and authorization requirements supersede other agencies'
requirements?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;No. Each regulatory agency develops ACW regulations for a specific purpose.
The Board developed LEA standards and authorization provisions for ACW in accordance with
State law. These provisions were created to meet mandated regulatory oversight at solid
waste landfills accepting friable ACW. The Board and its certified LEAs are responsible
for keeping track of which agency enforces a particular ACW regulation in order to prevent
regulatory overlap to the maximum extent possible. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;What triggers applicability of LEA standards and authorization?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: The conditions that trigger the LEA standards and authorization mechanisms are
summarized as follows:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>LEAs having solid waste facilities that <strong>already</strong> dispose of ACW in accordance with
    Section 25143.7 of the Health and Safety Code should be currently meeting, or shortly come
    into compliance with the LEA standards and authorization criteria (see 14 CCR §17897.15).
  </li>
  <li>LEAs having solid waste facilities that <strong>intend</strong> to dispose of ACW in accordance
    with Section 25143.7 of the Health and Safety Code will be required to meet existing LEA
    standards and authorization criteria (see 14 CCR §17897.15). </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;How does an LEA request authorization from the Board to carry out
enforcement responsibilities associated with Title 14, Division 7, Chapter 3.5? </i></p>

<p>A: &nbsp;LEAs are required to request authorization from the Board in writing and may
use <a href="applicat.doc">CIWMB Form 605 (Attachment 3)</a> <i>(Word 6.0,
22KB)</i>. Using this form, LEAs need to determine one of the following:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>Whether the agency will implement only sections 17897.15 - .16 and 178997.19 (a-c) of
    this chapter (provisional authorization); </li>
  <li>Whether the agency will implement all of the provisions of this chapter (full
    authorization); or </li>
  <li>Whether the agency will rely on the Board for existing ACW regulatory responsibilities. </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;For which type of Board authorization can LEAs apply?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;Certified LEAs that want to fulfill the enforcement
responsibilities arising from Title 14, Division 7, Chapter 3.5 may do so by requesting
provisional or full authorization from the Board. A LEA may use the following
conditions in order to determine which type of Board authorization applies to its
jurisdiction-specific needs:&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>A LEA, whose jurisdiction has a facility disposing of ACW but the ACW operations are not
    described in the permit, qualifies for provisional Board authorization.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A LEA whose jurisdiction has a facility with a permit that addresses ACW and was
    disposing of ACW before the regulations were adopted qualifies for provisional
    authorization. A LEA may request provisional authorization in cases where not all
    requirements can be fulfilled at the time of the request. Upon approval of the RDSI
    amendments the LEA should apply for full authorization.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A LEA whose jurisdiction has a permitted facility that disposes of ACW but whose permit
    does <i>not</i> address ACW disposal qualifies for provisional Board authorization.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A LEA whose jurisdiction has a permitted facility that has not disposed of ACW but
    intends to do so qualifies for either full or provisional Board authorization.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A LEA whose jurisdiction has a new facility that intends to dispose of ACW qualifies for
    full Board authorization. </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Q:&nbsp;What is the
difference between a fully authorized and a provisionally authorized LEA?</i> </p>

<p>A:&nbsp;14 CCR Section
17897.25 states that LEAs who meet subsection (a)(1) and (2) may be provisionally
authorized to enforce specific provisions of the chapter. Specifically, a provisionally
authorized LEA will be responsible for enforcing sections 17897.15 -.16 and 17897.19(a-c)
only. A fully authorized LEA will enforce the whole chapter. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;Can a LEA who has not obtained authorization from the Board enforce the ACW
regulations? &nbsp;</i> </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;No. LEAs are required to meet Article 5 of the ACW regulations before being
authorized to enforce the ACW regulations.&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>For a provisional authorization the LEA shall meet Section 17897.25 (a) (1-2). A
    provisionally authorized LEA would be responsible for enforcing Sections 17897.15-.16, and
    17897.19 (a).&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A full authorization must meet the complete section 17897.25 and the LEA would be
    responsible for enforcing the complete chapter. </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;What if a LEA opts to not apply for authorization to enforce this
chapter?&nbsp;</i> </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;If an LEA qualifies for Board authorization by having an ACW facility that
currently takes or plans to accept ACW, the Authorization Application form needs to be
completed by checking the box stating the LEA opts to not enforce this chapter and
understands the Board will carry out its provisions. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;Is there a final filing date by which facilities disposing of ACW must come
into compliance with Title 14, Division 7, Chapter 3.5 requirements?</i> </p>

<p>A:&nbsp;Yes. All
facilities disposing of ACW must be fully permitted for ACW activities by November 29,
1997. LEAs may seek full authorization prior to or upon concurrence of a new or revised
permit that includes ACW disposal.</p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;Which EPP components do LEAs need to revise as a part of the authorization
application?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;At a minimum, components per 14 CCR §18077, #9 (an operating budget
demonstrating adequacy of budget resources pursuant to 14 CCR 18074 (b) and (c)), and #10
(a detailed staff training procedure pursuant to 14 CCR §18075) will need to be revised
to reflect that the equipment and training requirements of the ACW regulations have been
met.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Other components may need revision based on the status of a facility in the LEAs
jurisdiction. For example, a new ACW operation on a new facility will need to be reflected
in the EPP's comprehensive list, and time task analysis in addition to the budget and
training components.&nbsp; </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;How does a LEA meet the training requirements set forth in Section 17897.25
(a)(2) and (4) of the ACW regulations?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;a) Each employer is responsible for its employees' health and safety program,
which includes health and safety training and the maintenance of its Illness and Injury
Prevention Plan (IIPP). Board staff will not &quot;approve&quot; Section 17897.25 (a)(2)
of the training requirement. By signing the application form, the LEA Director is
certifying the agency's compliance with this section. This Advisory however, provides
examples of the training Board staff undergo to satisfy its IIPP with respect to <a href="42attch4.htm">ACW inspections (Attachment 4)</a>. This training requirement should
be coordinated through your employer's IIPP manager.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In order to meet the intent of the regulation and CCR Title 8, General Industry Safety
Orders, the training should include: 

<ol>
  <li>Recognition of ACW and its physical characteristics. </li>
  <li>Health hazards associated with ACW. </li>
  <li>Assessment of the risk of asbestos exposure. </li>
  <li>Respiratory protection program requirements. </li>
  <li>Appropriate work practices and control methods. </li>
  <li>Emergency procedures. </li>
  <li>Air monitoring requirements and procedures. </li>
  <li>Medical surveillance program requirements. </li>
  <li>Proper ACW handling and disposal procedures. </li>
  <li>Housekeeping and personal hygiene practices.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Reference: CCR, Title 8, Sections 5208, 5144, &amp; 5192)&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>b) To meet the requirements of Section 17897.25 (a)(4), the LEA must submit an updated
EPP training component. This training should include asbestos sampling methodology and
practice.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Information regarding State certified training providers may be obtained by calling the
Cal/OSHA Asbestos Certification Unit at (916) 574-2993. Information regarding US EPA
training contacts can be obtained by calling U.S. EPA, Region 9, Asbestos Program, at
(415) 744-1093. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;How does an LEA comply with the personal protective equipment and sampling
equipment provisions stipulated in Section 17897.25 of the ACW regulations?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;Typical personal protective clothing used during ACW related inspections may
include respiratory protection, disposable coveralls, foot and head coverings, and gloves.
Inspectors directly involved in excavation, etc. should wear more specialized protective
clothing (i.e. disposable undergarments). The type of protective equipment use will depend
on the type of ACW activity that will be performed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In general, employers should provide (a) respirators and ensure that they are properly
used when required; and (b) protective clothing based on the type of inspection being
done. No inspector should be engaged in ACW related activities without personal protective
equipment she/he has been trained to wear.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Typical sampling equipment may include: large plastic trash bags, ziplock plastic
storage bags, labels, plastic sample jar, and a way to wet down the sample such as a water
spray bottle. </p>

<p><i>Q: &nbsp;Does the approval of authority need to go before the full Board for
concurrence?</i>&nbsp; </p>

<p>A: &nbsp;Pursuant to 14 CCR 17897.25, only the Board can grant
provisional or full authorization of ACW programs to LEAs. In accordance with PRC section
40430 which speaks to the Board's powers and duties relative to delegation of authority,
on July 25, 1997, the Board adopted Resolution #97-27. This resolution allows the
Executive Director to grant provisional or full authorization of ACW programs to LEAs in
compliance with State law. </p>
