    <p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this advisory is to provide guidance and information to the Solid Waste
Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) on oversight of disposal site postclosure land use
pursuant to Title 27, California Code of Regulations (27 CCR), section 21190. Specific
topics addressed include regulatory authority, activities subject to the regulatory tiers,
site boundary issues, proposal review, local approvals, technical assistance, and site
inspections. </p>

<h2><strong>Background</strong> </h2>

<p>Control of postclosure land use at solid waste disposal sites represents a major part
of the LEA&#146;s responsibility to protect public health and safety and the environment.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) established regulations
addressing postclosure land use activities in 1989 based on documented problems associated
with poorly regulated development on disposal sites (<i>Final Statement of Reasons,
Disposal Site Standards for Closure and Postclosure, Page III-7.8 129-139</i>). In many
cases, the CIWMB and LEA are still dealing with the consequences of poor past postclosure
land use practices. </p>

<p>Although there are many examples of poor postclosure land use practices, significant
recent advances in the land use development and environmental control of disposal sites
are evident. There are an increasing number of projects that have been successfully
constructed and maintained in compliance with current minimum standards.
<a href="../51/Attach1.htm">Attachment 1</a> is a list of selected examples of postclosure land
use projects developed in accordance with current minimum standards. Upon request, more
specific information concerning these and other projects can be provided by staff of the
CIWMB&#146;s Remediation, Closure, and Technical Services Branch. </p>

<p>Postclosure land use development can be a substantial benefit to local communities.
Attractive and useful postclosure land uses can help incorporate a closed site into the
surrounding community. Postclosure land use development can also provide a potential
source of financial resources to remediate environmental problems at sites where the
responsible parties are unable to finance remediation on their own. </p>

<h2>Regulatory Authority Over Postclosure Land Use Activities </h2>

<p>The specific minimum standard for postclosure land use at disposal sites is contained
in 27 CCR 21190 <a href="../51/Attach2.htm">(attachment 2)</a>. This standard is applicable to
new postclosure activities that may jeopardize the integrity of previously closed disposal
sites or pose a potential threat to public health and safety or the environment (27 CCR
21100(b)(2)). </p>

<p>CIWMB closure and postclosure maintenance plan requirements apply to all solid waste
landfills required to be permitted that were operating on or after January 1, 1988.
Closure and postclosure maintenance plans under these requirements require a description of proposed
postclosure land use per 27 CCR 21190. If the postclosure land use is proposed to
significantly change after approval of the final closure and postclosure maintenance plans
(final plans), revision of the final plans is required pursuant to 27 CCR 21890. The
revision for significant postclosure land use change must specifically address compliance
with 27 CCR 21190 and be approved by the LEA, Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB), and CIWMB. </p>

<p>CIWMB closure and postclosure maintenance plan requirements of 27 CCR Chapter 4,
Subchapter 4 are not applicable for sites that ceased operating prior to January 1, 1988
(27 CCR 21770(b)). If a significant change in postclosure land use is proposed for these
sites, a postclosure land use proposal should be submitted to the LEA to address
compliance with 27 CCR 21190. The LEA is required to approve the proposed postclosure land
use if the project involves structures within 1,000 feet of the disposal area, structures
on top of waste, modification of the low permeability layer, or irrigation over waste (27
CCR 21190(c)). </p>

<p>Many disposal sites have pre-existing postclosure land use activities (in place prior
to August 18, 1989). Review and approval of these land use activities under 27 CCR 21190
is not required. However, LEAs should note that there is significant flexibility in
applying minimum standards for closure and postclosure to pre-existing land use
activities. This flexibility is contained in 27 CCR 21100(d), which gives the LEA
authority to apply any closure or postclosure standard to these sites as necessary to
address a threat to public health and safety or the environment. Similar flexibility is
contained in 27 CCR 21100(f) which applies to non-municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF)
units (e.g., wood waste landfills). </p>

<h2>Activities Subject to the Regulatory Tiers </h2>

<p>Public Resources Code (PRC) Sections 44001 and 44002 require operators of solid waste
facilities to obtain solid waste facility permits. Therefore, activities subject to the
regulatory tiers, located within the boundaries of closed or closing disposal sites (e.g.,
composting facilities), must obtain the applicable solid waste permit before these
activities can commence unless specifically exempted or excluded. These activities are
also subject to the postclosure land use standards of 27 CCR 21190. Activities subject to
tiered permits must either be already incorporated into the approved final plans, or be
added as revisions to the approved final plans for closed or closing sites operating on or
after January 1, 1988. For sites that ceased operating prior to January 1, 1988, final
plans are not required and the proposed activities would be submitted as a proposal
pursuant to 27 CCR 21190. </p>

<p>If an activity changes beyond the approved land use change (e.g., new or expanded
layout, higher waste throughput, new permit tier activity) a new postclosure land use
proposal or revision to the final plans should be submitted. </p>

<h2>Site Boundary Issues </h2>

<p>&quot;Disposal site&quot; or &quot;site&quot; includes the place, location, tract of
land, area, or premises in use, intended to be used, or which has been used for the
landfill disposal of solid wastes (PRC Section 40122). In practice, this definition means
that any property located outside the parcel containing the solid waste is not subject to
the postclosure land use requirements of 27 CCR 21190, even if the outside property is
within 1,000 feet of the waste footprint (27 CCR 21190(c)). This can be problematic for
the CIWMB and LEA because parcel boundaries can be split from the disposal site, allowing
development close to the waste footprint without triggering postclosure land use controls
and approvals. </p>

<p>Local building codes and ordinances can provide enforceable buffer zones controlling
land use development adjacent to disposal sites (e.g., Los Angeles County building codes).
Another way for the LEA to influence the control of postclosure land use development
adjacent to disposal site parcels is to participate as early as possible in the local
planning process when rezoning and building permits come up for issuance. It is also
important to note that where the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has
jurisdiction over postclosure land use pursuant to California Health and Safety Code
Section 25221 (i.e., hazardous waste sites), it has broad authority over adjacent land use
activities on property outside the disposal area. </p>

<h2>Review of Postclosure Land Use Proposals </h2>

<p>Suggested guidelines for review of all postclosure land use proposals, revisions to
final plans, or portions of closure and postclosure maintenance plans, subject to 27 CCR
21190, are as follows: </p>

<p><strong>1. Project Description (27 CCR 21190(a-c))</strong> </p>

<p>Check description of postclosure land use activity and implementation schedule. Is the
detail sufficient to address 27 CCR 21190(a-c)? Review description of land use change to
ensure consistency with any required tier permit application and permit covering the
activity. </p>

<p>Check if the project involves waste excavation and relocation and/or consolidation. If
yes, a thorough description of this activity should be provided including project health
and safety measures and waste characterization, handling, processing, and placement. This
activity may also fall under DTSC jurisdiction if the waste is hazardous (e.g., burn dump
ash with residue exceeding hazardous levels for metals). Guidance for complete removal of
waste and waste residuals (&quot;clean closure&quot;) is contained in <a HREF="../16/default.htm">LEA Advisory No. 16</a>. For the specific case of burn dump
remediation, a separate LEA Advisory will be issued. </p>

<p><strong>2. CEQA</strong> </p>

<p>Does the proposal include verification of compliance with the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) (e.g., Notice of Determination)? CEQA is required for the discretionary
approval of a project by the LEA, which would include most postclosure land use changes.
In most cases the local planning department is lead agency for ensuring compliance with
CEQA requirements for these projects. If so, the LEA is a responsible agency and should
coordinate with the lead agency early in the process. </p>

<p><strong>3. Project Layout (27 CCR 21190(a-c))</strong> </p>

<p>Check site maps and grading plans to ensure that the specific limits of the land use
change are clearly delineated with respect to the closed disposal site and all existing
environmental monitoring and control systems. Check specifically for delineation of areas
on waste that will be irrigated or capped by relatively impermeable materials such as
asphalt concrete. These activities can result in increased landfill gas generation and
migration. Environmental monitoring and control systems to be evaluated include site
security, erosion control, drainage, leachate collection and removal, and landfill gas
monitoring and control. Research site files to determine if there are documented problems
with landfill gas, leachate, or drainage that must be specifically addressed in the
project. </p>

<p>All construction plans should be signed and stamped by an appropriately licensed
professional such as a person registered as a civil engineer in the State of California
[27 CCR 21780(a)]. </p>

<p><strong>4. Environmental Monitoring and Control Systems (27 CCR 21190(a),(d))</strong> </p>

<p>Check facility layout with respect to existing environmental monitoring and control
systems. Is the land use change compatible with the existing environmental monitoring and
control systems? Will these systems need to be expanded, decommissioned, or reconstructed?
If so, the proposal should include revised design plans, specifications, construction
schedule, and revisions to the postclosure monitoring and maintenance plan. If required,
it is important that on-site maintenance personnel implement monitoring and operations
plans for landfill gas, in addition to ensuring that methane alarm systems are maintained.
</p>

<p><strong>5. Structures (27 CCR 21190(c-g))</strong> </p>

<p>Does the proposal include enclosed structures on waste or within 1,000 feet of the
waste footprint within the property boundary? If yes, approval by the LEA is required (27
CCR 21190(c)). If yes, check to see if construction design standards of 27 CCR 21190(e)
and (g) are met in plans and specifications (flexible utility connections, floor slab
barrier, vent layer, vent piping, automatic methane sensors with alarm system, periodic
methane monitoring program of structure). Check for evaluation of slope stability to
ensure the integrity of landfill slopes under both static and dynamic conditions (27 CCR
21145). </p>

<p>Check that a construction quality assurance (CQA) plan has been submitted. A CQA plan
should be included to ensure that construction is completed in accordance with plans and
specifications. The CQA plan should also include submittal and certification of as-built
plans and specifications upon completion of construction. </p>

<p>Equivalent alternative designs can be proposed but must be supported for the intended
function. For example, it is very important that any alternative proposed to the standard
geomembrane barrier layer have documentation (e.g., manufacturer specifications) showing
equivalent low permeability to landfill gas. In addition, exemptions are allowed from the
construction standards if the applicant demonstrates on a site-specific basis that there
is no potential for adverse impacts on public health and safety and the environment from
landfill gas migration into structures. </p>

<p><strong>6. Pilings (27 CCR 21190(e)(6-7))</strong> </p>

<p>Construction of deep foundations with pilings in waste is a special case normally
requiring a licensed geotechnical engineer. Detailed plans and specifications are
necessary to ensure that penetrations of final cover are adequately sealed and that
appropriate corrosion resistance is provided. Check to ensure depth of piles does not
penetrate any bottom liner unless approved by the RWQCB. </p>

<p><strong>7. Modification or Replacement of Low Permeability Layer (27 CCR 21190(d))</strong> </p>

<p>Is the site required to have a low permeability layer in the final cover? For sites
that ceased accepting waste prior to January 1, 1988, this determination is frequently
made by the RWQCB, but the LEA has authority to require a low permeability layer if
necessary to protect public health and safety and the environment (e.g., landfill gas
control). If a low permeability layer is required, does the proposal include modification
or replacement of the low permeability layer of the final cover? If so, approval by the
LEA and RWQCB is required (27 CCR 21190(d)), and grading plans, specifications, and CQA
plans should also be included. </p>

<p><strong>8. Land Use on Final Cover (27 CCR 21190(a-c))</strong> </p>

<p>Is the postclosure land use change within areas underlain by final cover or waste? If
so, the land use should be evaluated with respect to potential settlement and damage to
the final cover. The evaluation should include an estimation of the potential settlement
as a result of the activity and whether or not the settlement is tolerable for the
integrity of the final cover and the activity proposed. If there is the potential for
significant settlement the methods for monitoring and repair should be included. </p>

<p>Is the addition of a soil cover needed to protect public health and safety (e.g., to
prevent public contact with waste)? If so, plans and specifications for the additional
cover should be included. </p>

<h2>Local (City, County, or Regional) Project Approvals </h2>

<p>Reviewers of postclosure land use proposals should also note that separate local
permits or approvals (e.g., building, grading, conditional use, air district) may be
required for the project depending on local codes and ordinances. Conflicts can arise due
to the overlapping reviews and approvals of these agencies. Therefore, LEAs should contact
the other applicable local agencies as early in the development of the postclosure land
use project as possible to help coordinate the reviews and approvals. </p>

<h2>Technical Assistance </h2>

<p>Staff from the CIWMB Remediation, Closure, and Technical Services Branch is available
to LEAs, other agencies, and project applicants for technical assistance on disposal site
postclosure land use. Licensed engineers from the branch are also available to the LEA if
requested to assist in the review and approval of postclosure construction projects. </p>

<h2>Site Inspections </h2>

<p>A major aspect of disposal site inspections for postclosure land use is to ensure that
there is no change or expansion in land use activities without prior comment or approval
as required. For example, LEAs have been faced with unauthorized construction activities
on disposal sites where a significant landfill gas hazard is suspected, and no control
systems have been planned. This situation would constitute a violation of 27 CCR 21190 and
would warrant prompt enforcement action by the LEA to address the problem. LEAs should
also inspect approved projects under construction to ensure that the approved plans and
specifications are being addressed. </p>

<p>If the LEA observes a potential threat to public health and safety or the environment
at a site with an existing or approved new postclosure land use activity a violation or
area of concern should be issued. Examples of such observations would include, but not be
limited to: 

<ul>
  <li>Exposure of the public to waste. </li>
  <li>Excessive differential settlement in areas over waste (damage to buildings, utilities,
    parking lots, and roads; ponding on waste; surface cracking with the potential for release
    of gas into structures). </li>
  <li>Detection of landfill gas within structures or appurtenant utilities exceeding 1.25 %
    methane by volume in air. </li>
  <li>Non-operational methane alarm systems. </li>
  <li>Failure to monitor and control landfill gas as required. </li>
</ul>

<p>A violation or area of concern should be issued based on the inspector&#146;s
determination of threat to public health and safety or the environment. Detection of
methane greater than 1.25 % in enclosed structures should be cited as a violation of 27
CCR 21190, 20919, and for municipal solid waste landfills, 27 CCR 20919.5. </p>

<p>The owner&#146;s promptness in correcting violations would bear on what level of
enforcement action is appropriate. LEA staff should contact their Remediation, Closure,
and Technical Services Branch staff liaison if specific examples of enforcement orders on
closed sites are desired, or if assistance in site inspections is desired. </p>

<h2>Tracking of Postclosure Land Use Changes </h2>

<p>To control potential postclosure land use changes and justify a reduction in inspection
frequencies a tracking system is recommended. Such a tracking system would typically
involve a computer database system by which other local approval agencies (e.g., planning,
building departments) flag parcels for referral to LEAs when a permit or approval is
requested. This would allow the LEA to be involved early in the development process so
that later conflicts are avoided. In some cases deed restrictions on disposal site
properties have been applied, although that process would normally require the involvement
of county counsel and would need to occur before property is conveyed to another party. </p>

<p>Further questions or technical assistance concerning postclosure land use and the
topics discussed may be directed to Remediation, Closure, and Technical Services Branch
liaisons. </p>
