<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></strong></h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA)
and California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) staff regarding procedures for
conducting inspections of solid waste landfills, including interpretation and application
of statutes and regulations governing these types of facilities. LEA inspections are the
cornerstones of a comprehensive enforcement program designed to protect public health and
safety and the environment by ensuring compliance at solid waste facilities with
applicable statutes and regulations. They provide information to the operator regarding
violations of applicable requirements and also serve as notice to take actions to correct
those violations. In addition, field inspections provide the information needed to
initiate most of the LEA&#146;s enforcement actions.</p>

<p>CIWMB inspections of a solid waste facility (SWF) serve several purposes. They
establish a compliance status that is useful in evaluating the effectiveness of LEA
enforcement programs. They support LEAs by jointly evaluating facilities that have
particularly complex or long-standing compliance or permit related problems or issues.
They also help train LEAs on the inspection guidance in this advisory and provide
technical assistance on other aspects of landfill inspections such as explosive gas
monitoring procedures. The CIWMB can, and does, act as the Enforcement Agency (EA) in
several jurisdictions in the state and, acting in that capacity, the CIWMB plays a role
identical to that of an LEA.*</p>

<p>Title 27, California Code of Regulations (27 CCR) incorporates into one title the
applicable regulations regarding the disposition of solid waste at solid waste disposal
facilities that are under the regulatory jurisdiction of the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB), Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB), LEAs, and the CIWMB. The
applicable statutes and regulations of Division 30 of the Public Resources Code (PRC) and
27 CCR regarding solid waste disposal sites are listed on the Solid Waste Information
System (SWIS) inspection report form for Disposal Sites, and are bolded, italicized, and
generally included in their entirety. In addition, some regulations that pertain to the
evaluation of solid waste disposal sites and are still found in Title 14, California Code
of Regulations (14 CCR) have also been included in this document.</p>

<p>In this document, guidelines regarding each applicable statute in the PRC and
regulation in 27 CCR, that is under the jurisdiction of the CIWMB and the LEA follows
immediately below each statute and regulation. Requirements of other agencies that are
referenced either in the CIWMB standards below (State Minimum Standards) or in the
guidelines are included as appendices. For ease in completion of the SWIS inspection
report form for Disposal Sites the applicable statutes and regulations are listed in the
order in which they are found on the current SWIS inspection report form (Revised July
1997).</p>

<p>*All references in this document to the term 'EA' apply to both LEAs and the CIWMB
acting as EA. All references to the term 'LEA' are intended as guidance that should apply
to LEAs only.</p>

<p>Regulations and guidance regarding the storage and disposal of tires at landfills are
also included here (14 CCR). Guidelines for inspection of waste tire facilities will be
addressed in a future advisory. Guidance for the inspection of facilities that are
permitted to handle asbestos containing wastes (ACW) will also be found in a separate
advisory.</p>

<p>In this document guidance is presented for evaluating a solid waste disposal facility's
compliance with permitting aspects of Division 30 of the PRC and with 27 CCR, as well as
with still applicable 14 CCR requirements. Since levels of experience vary among
inspectors this document is designed to assist inspectors with all levels of expertise in
the field.</p>

<h2><a name="AB1220">Assembly Bill 1220</a></h2>

<p>With the enactment of the Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act (AB 1220) as an
urgency statute on October 1, 1993, the CIWMB was required to remove overlap, duplication,
and conflict with other state and local agencies, in particular the SWRCB and the RWQCBs,
in the regulation of solid waste disposal facilities. On July 18, 1997, the regulations
became effective. Inspection guidance presented here suggests coordination with other
agencies where there are shared areas of concern.</p>

    <strong>

<h2><a name="InspectionRequirements">Inspection Requirements</a></h2>

    </strong>

<h3><a name="Local">Local Requirements</a></h3>

<p>The LEA is required under PRC §43209 to develop, implement, and maintain an inspection
program. 14 CCR §18303 requires the LEA to &quot;conduct investigations of allegations
and of all SWFs where it has reason to believe that a violation exists.&quot; In
accordance with PRC §43218 the LEA is required to inspect each fully permitted SWF within
its jurisdiction at least one time each month. Facilities that qualify for other types of
permits under the CIWMB tiered permitting structure may be inspected at different
frequencies. Most landfills and disposal sites fall into the fully permitted category. The
LEA is required by 14 CCR §18083 to inspect SWFs and disposal sites at the following
frequency: 

<ul>
  <li>Monthly for active, inactive, and illegal sites.</li>
  <li>Weekly for sites implementing demonstration projects for nonapproved alternative daily
    cover (ADC) materials.</li>
  <li>Quarterly for closed, abandoned, and exempt sites.</li>
  <li>As necessary for permit actions or complaints.</li>
</ul>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> Facilities implementing an ADC demonstration project for ADC materials
not addressed in 27 CCR §20690 may require weekly inspection frequency for the duration
of the demonstration.</p>

<h3><a name="State">State Requirements</a></h3>

<p>The CIWMB is required to conduct at least one inspection every 18 months of each solid
waste landfill and transformation facility and submit a written inspection report to the
LEA within 30 days of the inspection (PRC §43220). The CIWMB may also conduct inspections
and investigations of SWFs to evaluate the LEA and to ensure that State Minimum Standards
(SMS) are met (PRC §§ 43214(a), 43219). When the CIWMB is acting as the EA it will
inspect sites at the same frequencies as those required of the LEA.</p>

    <strong>

<p><a name="SubtitleD">State
Regulations to Implement Federal Subtitle D Requirements</a></strong></p>

<p>The federal municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) regulations (Subtitle D) were
adopted under Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR), Parts 257 and 258 on October
9, 1991. California's solid waste permitting program was approved by the U.S. EPA on
October 1, 1993; therefore, California is an Approved State. The program is implemented
jointly by the CIWMB, SWRCB, and RWQCBs. Compliance with California's program ensures
compliance with the federal criteria and allows the CIWMB to implement the full
flexibility allowed under Subtitle D for that portion of the program that is administered
by the CIWMB. The CIWMB's portion of the program was formerly contained in 14 CCR. As a
result of AB 1220 that portion is now incorporated into 27 CCR, Sections 20164, 20270,
20515, 20680, 20870, 20900, and 20919.5.</p>

<p>LEA Advisory #37, <i>Small Dry Landfills&#151;Delay of
Subtitle D General Compliance Date (</i><span class="Alert">Rescinded January 
15, 2002</span>) provides guidance to enforcement agencies on
federal compliance dates for qualifying small, dry, or remote landfills that met the
required criteria. This advisory also contains a listing of those small dry MSWLFs that
met the tonnage and precipitation criteria of 40 CFR 258.1(f)(1) and that were potential
qualifiers for delay of the compliance date until October 7, 1997 (see Appendix N for
federal criteria). <strong></p>

<p>Recent Revisions to Criteria for Small Landfills</strong></p>

<p>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996 directed the administrator of the
U.S. EPA to provide additional flexibility within the Subtitle D regulations to approved
states for any landfill that receives 20 tons or less of municipal solid waste per day,
based on an annual average. On October 27, 1997, the final rule of the U.S. EPA providing
additional regulatory flexibility to Approved States became effective (Appendix N). The
additional flexibility applies to: 

<ul>
  <li>Alternative frequencies of daily cover.</li>
  <li>Alternative frequencies of methane monitoring.</li>
  <li>Alternative final cover.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>How Will This Affect Qualifying MSWLFs?</strong></p>

<p>The CIWMB has adopted emergency regulations, soon to be adopted by the Office of
Administrative Law (OAL), to allow the regulatory flexibilities in the first two areas for
small qualifying landfills. Applicability will be determined after public review and
comment and consideration of the climate, hydrogeology, and unique characteristics of
small communities. Allowing the flexibility would be determined by the LEA, with
concurrence by the CIWMB.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that this additional flexibility considers alternative
frequencies for daily cover and methane monitoring only. It does not include the following
Subtitle D requirements that were incorporated as regulations into 14 CCR and, eventually,
27 CCR:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>27 CCR 20270&#151;Airport Safety<br />
    27 CCR 20515&#151;MSWLF Unit Records<br />
    27 CCR 20870&#151;Hazardous Wastes<br />
    27 CCR 20900&#151;Air Criteria </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, any small, dry landfills that qualified for the extended date of October 9, 1997
to come into compliance with Subtitle D requirements (incorporated into 27 CCR) must now
comply with the four standards listed above.</p>
<strong>

<p>How/When Will This Additional Flexibility Be Implemented?</strong></p>

<p>Emergency regulations adopted by the CIWMB in April 1998 should be in effect some time
in November or December 1998.</p>
<strong>

<p>Recommendations for Those MSWLFs That May Qualify for the Additional Flexibility in
Subtitle D Compliance</strong></p>

<p>Until the emergency regulations developed for implementing the additional flexibility
are approved by OAL CIWMB staff recommend that the LEA assess the operations of MSWLFs
potentially qualifying (i.e., receiving less than 20 tons per day) and take action as
necessary to maintain public health and safety and protect the environment. Once the
regulations are in force LEAs will be notified and an advisory will be distributed to
provide guidance for implementing the regulations.</p>
