<h2><a name="Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>Early in the day the inspector should determine the best time to interview appropriate
site personnel and to inspect facility records. This will allow the inspector to ensure
that a supervisor or facility manager is present to answer questions and to find or
provide access to necessary records.</p>

<p>The inspector should carry a SWIS inspection report form for disposal sites (Appendix
B), some blank paper, a CGI, appropriate health and safety equipment, and a camera
throughout the inspection. This allows notes and photographs to be taken as issues arise.
It also serves to prevent missing one-of-a-kind photo opportunities. Throughout the
inspection the inspector should periodically refer to the SWIS report form to assure that
each standard is addressed and that there is enough time to evaluate the remaining
standards.</p>

<p>The inspector should also bring a copy of a facility map or diagram. When possible,
compliance status and all notes, observations, and applicable comments should be recorded
during the inspection, not later in the office.</p>

<p>Evidence includes all field notes, SWIS inspection forms, results of gas monitoring,
photographs, samples, drawings, and maps taken or made by the inspector on the day of the
inspection. The inspector should maintain control of all such evidence during an
inspection and thoroughly review it before leaving the site.</p>

<p>Field notes should be used to record the results of all LFG sampling, measurements, and
performance standard testing. To ensure proper documentation field notes should be signed,
dated, and contain the facility file number. These field notes are subject to public
records requests.</p>

<p>Photographs provide the best documentation of what an inspector has actually observed
and, when possible, the inspector should document each violation with photographs.
Therefore, it is extremely important that each photograph be properly identified and tied
into the inspection report for later use as evidence. It is also preferable that no
telephoto or wide angle lens be used as they may distort both the scale and the image.</p>

<p>The inspector should note the facility name, facility file number, date, time, film
roll number, direction faced, and name of the inspector taking the pictures in his/her
notes. Later, when the developed slides or prints become available, the inspector should
transfer this data to the prints or slides and initial or sign each one. Cameras with
date/time stamp capability can make this task much easier. When taking photos the
inspector should include some items that will show comparative scale, such as a clipboard,
person, or vehicle. Ideally, the violation should be clearly shown in each photo. Portable
video equipment is also available to CIWMB inspectors for documentation purposes&#151;an
LEA may request that a CIWMB inspector document violations with this equipment.</p>

<p>Maps and drawings can be used to document the facility layout on the day of the
inspection as well as the location of violations and photo points. These should be
carefully drawn with only the necessary details. A compass should always be used to
establish a north arrow. Actual distances (from hip chain measurements or measuring
wheels) should be shown when necessary.</p>

<p>If an observation is the only evidence of a violation the inspector should describe the
activity causing the condition of violation either in the inspection report or notice of
violation, including maps or diagrams where appropriate. This description should include
how the violation was discovered, what the inspector observed, and why the observation
should be considered a violation. When a subjective judgement is made regarding the
adequacy of monitoring or controlling the effects of an operation a complete discussion of
the facts should include the adequacy of those controls.</p>

<h2><a name="EAApprovals">Enforcement Agency Approvals</a></h2>

<p>The following 27 CCR standards may require the EA to provide a finding, determination,
requirement, or approval to the operator of a solid waste landfill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>20510&#151;Disposal Site Records<br />
    20515&#151;MSWLF Records<br />
    20517&#151;Documentation of Enforcement Agency Approvals, Determinations, and Requirements<br />
    20520&#151;Signs<br />
    20530&#151;Site Security<br />
    20550&#151;Sanitary Facilities<br />

    20580&#151;Lighting<br />
    20590&#151;Personnel Health and Safety<br />
    20620&#151;Site Attendant<br />
    20630&#151;Confined Unloading<br />
    20640&#151;Spreading and Compacting<br />
    20650&#151;Grading of Fill Surfaces<br />
    20670&#151;Availability of Cover Material<br />

    20919&#151;Gas Control<br />
    20919.5&#151;Explosive Gases Control<br />
    21780&#151;Submittal of Closure Plans</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The EA should review the above standards to assess those requirements that may require
additional guidance and/or action to the operator of a SWF. For example, Section 20510
states that &quot;each site operator shall maintain records of weights or volumes accepted
in a form and manner approved by the enforcement agency.&quot; The EA should establish
written requirements for maintenance of these records, e.g., kept in a binder and copies
sent by the operator to the EA on a monthly basis. These requirements should be forwarded
to the operator and placed in the operating record and may be included in the EA's
Enforcement Program Plan (EPP).</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> 14 CCR §18077(a) requires that, &quot;At a minimum, the EPP shall
include the following written components: a procedure manual for inspection,
investigation, compliance assurance, enforcement, and hearing panel utilization.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table

<h2><a name="OperatingRecord">Operating Record</a></h2>

<p>One of the requirements of the Federal Subtitle D regulations that was incorporated
into 27 CCR was the requirement for an operating record to be kept at the landfill or a
nearby location. The operating record is required to contain information that will
document activities, approvals, problems, excavations, training, etc. The following
standards compel specific information to be placed in the operating record. The record
shall be available during normal business hours for review by appropriate agencies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>27 CCR §20270&#151;Airport Safety Demonstration<br />
    27 CCR §20515&#151;Disposal Site Operating Records<br />
    27 CCR §20515&#151;MSWLF Unit Records<br />
    27 CCR §20517&#151;Documentation of EA Approvals, Determinations and Requirements<br />
    27 CCR §20610&#151;Training<br />
    27 CCR §20615&#151;Supervision<br />
    27 CCR §20870&#151;Hazardous Wastes<br />
    27 CCR §20919.5&#151;Gas monitoring<br />
    27 CCR §21780&#151;Closure/Postclosure Maintenance Plan</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="OtherRecords">Other Records</a></h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances other documents may be reviewed to assess compliance with
SMS, e.g., salvage material removal records. Salvaged material storage records may
indicate the types of materials being salvaged and their removal frequency. Other
documents related to the storage and disposal of waste tires may also need to be reviewed.</p>


<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table
of Contents</a></p>

</font>

<h2><a name="InspectionReport">Inspection Report</a></h2>

<p>The LEA is required by PRC §43218 to file, within 30 days of the inspection, a written
inspection report in a format prescribed by the CIWMB. The prescribed format for this
report is the SWIS inspection form. LEA inspection reports should be completed and
forwarded to the CIWMB Permitting and Inspection Branch staff person assigned to that
jurisdiction. The CIWMB is required by PRC §43220 to prepare and submit a written
inspection report within 30 days to the LEA of any state inspection.</p>

<h2><a name="FollowUp">Follow-Up Inspections</a></h2>

<p>Follow-up inspections to determine whether a facility has corrected past violations
should occur as soon as possible after the established deadline for correction has
elapsed.</p>

<h2><a name="InteragencyCoordination">Interagency Coordination</a></h2>

<p>In addition to the CIWMB and LEAs a number of governmental agencies have authority over
solid waste disposal. Potential and/or alleged violations of other agencies' statutes and
regulations should be noted on the inspection report and the appropriate agency should be
contacted. Agencies that may have authority over disposal sites include the SWRCB, a
RWQCB, the Department of Health Services (DHS), the Department of Toxic Substances Control
(DTSC), the Department of Forestry, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health
(Cal-OSHA), the Air Resources Board (ARB), local Air Pollution Control District (APCD) or
Air Quality Management District (AQMD), local and state fire agencies, the U.S. Army Corp
of Engineers, the Coastal Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department
of Fish and Game, and the U.S. EPA. The CIWMB recommends that the EA send a letter to
appropriate agencies requesting ongoing notification of any violation under their
respective jurisdictions at a SWF. Information gathered through interagency communication
will allow the inspector to learn of potential or ongoing problems that come primarily
under the authority of other applicable agencies yet may be referenced by 27 CCR.</p>

<p>When an inspector observes problems or possible violations of regulations not contained
in, or addressed by, 27 CCR, such as a potential health and safety violation
(Cal-OSHA&#150;CCR, Title 8) or a potential toxics issue (DTSC&#150;CCR, Title 22) the EA
shall refer the matter to the applicable agency or agencies by inspection report, which
should contain field notes regarding what was observed. Although apparent issues that
would be the responsibility of a different agency may be noted on the inspection report,
the EA may not cite a violation that is not contained within the CIWMB's jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This inspection report should then be forwarded under cover letter addressed to the
director of the appropriate agency for resolution. Inspection reports filed by LEAs should
also be clearly identified by cover letter as a separate referral issue. The CIWMB will
provide a designated staff member who will be responsible for monitoring all referrals
generated by LEA staff and forwarded to the appropriate state agencies for resolution.</p>

<p>Finally, PRC §44106(d) requires the EA to refer apparent violations of a waste
discharge requirement adopted under Section 13263 of the Water Code to the appropriate
regional water board.</p>
