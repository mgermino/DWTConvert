<h3><a name="Scavenging">Scavenging/Salvaging/Processing</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20710 Scavenging, Salvaging and Storage</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Scavenging is prohibited at any disposal site.</p>
  <p>(b) Salvaging as approved by the EA shall be conducted in a planned and controlled
  manner and shall not interfere with other aspects of site operations, including the
  expeditious entry and egress of vehicles at the site.</p>
  <p>(c) Salvaged materials generated on-site or imported shall be placed for storage in a
  specified clearly identifiable area segregated from the working face. Salvaged materials
  shall be arranged so as to minimize risk of fire or other hazard or nuisance, and be
  limited to a volume as approved by the EA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Salvaging is distinguished from scavenging in that salvaging is a permitted activity
and carried out by facility staff. Salvaging operations should be described in the JTD.
The storage of salvaged materials should not interfere with other operations and the
height and volume of stored salvage, especially piles of salvaged metals, should not be
conducive to possible safety, health, or fire problems.</p>

<p>The inspector should request to see documentation of removal frequency for each type of
material being stored, e.g., tires, white goods. Removal frequencies may vary but should
be reasonable and account for the amount and type of material being stored as well as
proximity to markets for that material or commodity.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> California Penal Code, §402(b) (Appendix D) requires that doors be
removed or latches disabled from discarded white goods to prevent children from becoming
entrapped.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20720 Non-Salvageable Items</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drugs, cosmetics, foods, beverages, hazardous chemicals, poisons, medical wastes,
  syringes, needles, pesticides and other similar materials capable of impairing public
  health shall not be salvaged unless approved by the EA and the local health agency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is recommended that any approval by the EA to salvage items described in the section
be placed in the operating record.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20730 Volume Reduction and Energy Recovery</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Volume reduction such as incineration, baling, shredding, composting, pyrolysis, and
  materials and energy recovery operations as approved by the EA shall be confined to
  specified, clearly identifiable areas of the site. If volume reduction is conducted,
  operations shall be done in a controlled manner as an integral part of the operation and
  not interfere with the proper construction and maintenance of the site or create health,
  safety, or environmental problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspector should look for the creation of excessive dust, litter, or incidental
waste during volume reduction activities. Repeated or excessive handling of materials
during volume reduction or resource recovery on site may significantly increase the impact
that segregating these by-products have on the rest of the operation, especially the
creation of excessive dust and litter.</p>

<h2><a name="Equipment">Equipment</a><i></h2>

<p></i>27 CCR §20740 Equipment</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Equipment shall be adequate in type, capacity and number, and sufficiently maintained
  to permit the site operation to meet requirements of these standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the inspection the inspector should visually evaluate the overall
maintenance level of site equipment, and the quality of site maintenance facilities. The
inspector should also evaluate the size and adequacy of the equipment to carry out
operations, including the types and quantities of major landfill equipment such as dozers,
scrapers, compactors, and water trucks. Equipment breakdowns happen often at landfills.
However, major or widespread equipment breakdowns prior to or during the inspection may be
indicative of an overall maintenance problem. Chronic or frequent violations of sections
§20680 (Cover), §20640 (Spreading and Compacting), §20700 (Intermediate Cover), and
§20650 (Grading of Fill Surfaces) may suggest equipment problems.</p>

<h3><a name="Maintenance">Maintenance</a></h3>

<strong>

<p>27 CCR §20750 Site Maintenance</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operator shall implement a preventative maintenance program to monitor and promptly
  repair or correct deteriorated or defective conditions with respect to requirements of the
  CIWMB standards, and conditions established by the EA. All other aspects of the site shall
  be kept in a state of reasonable repair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evaluation of a facility under this section involves observation of the basic
maintenance level of environmental control systems (e.g., landfill gas control system),
cover, signs, roads, grading, drainage and erosion controls, and other maintenance
conditions. When an inspector finds three or more violations of the above SMS it is likely
that the requirements of this section are not being met. The inspector should note an area
of concern or a violation.</p>

<h3><a name="Nuisance">Nuisance</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20760 Nuisance Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each disposal site shall be operated and maintained so as not to create a public
  nuisance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Section 20164 defines &quot;nuisance&quot; as &quot;anything that is injurious to human
health or is indecent or offensive to the senses and interferes with the comfortable
enjoyment of life or property, and affects at the same time an entire community,
neighborhood, household or any considerable number of persons although the extent of
annoyance or damage inflicted upon an individual may be unequal and that occurs as a
result of the storage, removal, transport, processing or disposal of solid waste.&quot;</p>

<p>Violations of other standards can exist without necessarily being or becoming a
nuisance. If the EA feels that a documented violation also constitutes a nuisance, then a
violation of this section is warranted, which may give the EA more enforcement authority
in resolving the outstanding problem.</p>

<p>This standard may be used to address a noise nuisance since §20840&#150;Noise Control
only addresses health hazards from noise. In addition, a glare nuisance may be addressed
under this standard. If a nuisance is related to water quality the appropriate RWQCB
should be informed. An example would be receipt of a complaint of odor or color changes
observed in water from domestic wells that may have occurred as a result of landfill
operations.</p>

<p>Odors are excessive at a disposal site if they are detected at objectionable levels by
the inspector at a property boundary bordered by residences or other sensitive receptors.
The detection of off-site odors may result from landfill gases that typically consist of
potentially hazardous and toxic components. Use of odor masking agents does not alleviate
any hazard from landfill gas. Their use may actually interfere with the detection and
monitoring of landfill gases making it difficult to evaluate their potentially harmful
effects and may delay required corrective action. Chronic and/or excessive odors should be
brought to the attention of the appropriate air quality agency (AQMD, APCD, or ARB).</p>

<p>An area of concern may be noted if the site has had numerous odor violations issued by
the APCD or AQMD and/or a recent history of citizen complaints, but the inspector does not
observe a violation of this standard during the inspection.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20770 Animal Feeding</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feeding of solid waste to animals that will be used for human consumption is expressly
  prohibited on disposal sites. Grazing of livestock away from operating areas is permitted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further guidance is not necessary.<i></p>

<p></i><a href="54part1.htm">Table
of Contents</a></p><strong>
<p>27 CCR §20780 Open Burning and Burning Wastes</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Open burning of solid waste, except for the infrequent burning of agricultural
  wastes, silvicultural wastes, landclearing debris, diseased trees, or debris from
  emergency clean-up operations, is prohibited at all solid waste landfills.</p>
  <p>(b) If burning wastes are received, they shall be deposited in a safe area and
  extinguished. If burning wastes have been placed in an active face, they shall be
  immediately excavated, spread and extinguished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open burning is defined under §20164. Burning of exempted waste must be done in an
area dedicated for that purpose away from the working/tipping area to avoid the accidental
burning of other solid waste. All approvals from involved authorities should be obtained
prior to the commencement of burning. Burning of solid waste in an incinerator that is not
equipped with adequate air pollution control equipment is also prohibited. Routine burning
of solid waste is prohibited at all MSWLF units.</p>

<p>Disposal sites must comply with all fire control requirements of local fire control
authorities or with other fire line or firebreak requirements in the SWFP. If it is
determined that requirements are not being met the local fire authority should be
informed. The inspector should note a violation if there is intentional burning at the
site or a hot load (smoldering ashes) is received and the above procedures are not
followed. The local fire authority should be informed. Accidental fires are not a
violation of this standard.</p>

<p>The RWQCB should be informed, if they do not already know, of discharges resulting from
fire or fire extinguishing. Possibly hazardous discharges resulting from tire fires should
be brought to the attention of the local Hazardous Materials Team and the DTSC.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> PRC §44151 requires that any solid waste facility, located outside of
any city, be maintained in compliance with the flammable clearance provisions of Chapter 5
(commencing with Section 4371) of Part 2 of Division 4 (Appendix E). PRC §4373 requires
those facilities to maintain a clearance of flammable material for a minimum distance of
150 feet from the periphery of any exposed flammable solid waste.</p>

<h3><a name="Leachate">Leachate</a></h3>

<strong>

<p>27 CCR §20790 Leachate Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operator shall ensure that leachate is controlled to prevent contact with the
  public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As defined in §20164, &quot;leachate means any liquid formed by the drainage of
liquids from waste or by the percolation or flow of liquid through waste.&quot; Leachate
can contain pathogens, heavy metals, and a variety of organic chemicals including known
carcinogens such as benzene and vinyl chloride.</p>

<p>An observed or suspected leachate problem should immediately be brought to the
attention of the appropriate RWQCB staff contact. Through consultation with the RWQCB and
the CIWMB, a determination should be made about whether interim actions are needed,
pending test results, to contain the suspected leachate. If the inspector has evidence
that waste is in contact with groundwater or observes waste in contact with surface or
groundwater (e.g., in trenches) this should also be communicated to the RWQCB.</p>

<p>During inspection preparation and review of the facility files the inspector should
contact the appropriate staff person at the applicable RWQCB to determine if they have
discovered problems with the facility's leachate collection and recovery system and/or
leachate management program and whether there are enforcement or corrective actions in
effect. This information, in conjunction with field observations, is used in evaluating
the operator's compliance with the leachate standard and might be included in an
inspection report.</p>

<p>Inspectors should always make their own observations during the inspection and document
any observations supporting or expanding on the status of the facility's leachate
collection and recovery system and/or leachate management program. The following guidance
should be applied to possible leachate violations:</p>

<p>A violation of this standard will exist if: 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>The inspector observes liquid that has percolated through waste and flowed beyond the
    permitted boundary of the site.</li>
  <li>Leachate management practices result in potential contact of leachate with humans.</li>
  <li>Required leachate monitoring, control, and/or treatment systems are determined to be
    deficient or nonfunctional on the day of the inspection.</li>
</ol>

<p>An &quot;area of concern&quot; will exist if: 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>Liquid that has percolated through waste is observed flowing or ponding on fill slopes,
    but is not migrating beyond the permitted site boundary (in such cases other standards may
    apply, e.g., grading).</li>
  <li>During the perimeter walk the inspector has reason to suspect that surface water leaving
    the site boundary is contaminated to its appearance, odor, or location.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, if any of these conditions are observed during the inspection and RWQCB staff is
not present the issue should be referred to the regional board for resolution.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> Water quality impairment can also occur when constituent compounds found
in landfill gases are transferred to groundwater through gas migration.</p>

<p><a href="54part1.htm">Table

<h3><a name="Dust">Dust</a></h3>
<strong>
<i>

<p></i>27 CCR §20800 Dust Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operator shall take adequate measures to minimize the creation of dust and prevent
  safety hazards due to obscured visibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the inspection the inspector should evaluate dust control measures being
taken by the operator. Dust control measures should be described in the JTD. If excessive
dust is observed and the operator has taken no steps to control it (e.g., using a water
truck) the facility is violating this section.</p>

<p>One or more of the following may be an indication that dust is excessive: (1) safety
hazards due to obscured visibility; (2) irritation of the eyes; (3) hampered breathing; or
(4) migration of dust off site.</p>

<p>Since this section was written, it has been determined that part of this requirement is
within the jurisdiction of Cal-OSHA. Therefore, where the only impact is to personnel
health and safety a referral should be made to Cal-OSHA. The RWQCB should be informed when
new measures are proposed that include the use of leachate for dust suppression or
irrigation. An area of concern may be considered if the site has numerous violations
concerning dust control issued by the APCD or AQMD and/or a recent history of citizen
complaints, but the inspector does not observe a violation of this standard during the
inspection.</p>
