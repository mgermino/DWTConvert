<h3><a name="Vectors">Vectors/Birds</a></h3>

<strong>

<p>27 CCR §20810 Vector and Bird Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operator shall take adequate steps to control or prevent the propagation, harborage
  or attraction of flies, rodents or other vectors and to minimize bird problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspector may want to evaluate a vector problem over a period of several days to
determine: 

<ul>
  <li>Can the source of vectors be verified as coming from the site?</li>
  <li>Can the source of vectors be verified as coming from elsewhere? </li>
  <li>Are vectors being transported in by vehicles carrying waste?</li>
  <li>Where are the nearest neighbors located?</li>
  <li>Is the problem an ongoing one?</li>
</ul>

<p>The operator of a landfill with bird problems should be encouraged to use the wire/grid
system after consultation with the Department of Fish and Game. Potential bird hazards to
aircraft at a facility within 10,000 feet of an airport should be evaluated for compliance
with §20270&#150;Airport Safety. Nuisance problems concerning the migration of birds from
a landfill to nearby residences should be addressed under this standard. In addition, bird
problems may include the propagation, harborage or attraction of birds that are natural
enemies of endangered or threatened species that are endemic to the area surrounding a
site (e.g., desert sites where ravens, a natural enemy of the desert tortoise, are
attracted to landfills).</p>

<p>An inspector should consider a site to be in violation of this section if excessive
numbers of adult flies are present or if immature stages of flies or mosquitoes (larvae or
pupae) are observed developing to the adult stage on site. It is a good indication that
flies or mosquitoes are excessive if the inspector begins to notice and is bothered by
them while walking around the site. If clusters or groupings of flies are seen on fences,
walls, vehicles, or other lower attractant areas there is a fly problem.</p>

<p>If a live rat is seen on the disposal site during the inspection this is an indication
that more rats exist and that the facility may have a rat problem. Active rat burrows or
fresh droppings also indicate a rat problem. Also, many ground squirrel burrows near the
working face of the landfill are an indication that these rodents are filling the rat's
ecological niche. These rodents can act as disease vectors.</p>

    <h3><a name="Drainage">Drainage/Erosion</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20820 Drainage and Erosion Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The drainage system shall be designed and maintained to:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) ensure integrity of roads, structures, and gas monitoring and control systems;</p>
    <p>(2) prevent safety hazards;</p>
    <p>(3) prevent exposure of waste.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The adequacy of the drainage structures may be determined by comparing them with the
design specified in the JTD and should be verified with the RWQCB. Erosion on any area of
a disposal site's fill surface that exposes waste and has not been promptly repaired
should signal the inspector that the site may be in violation of this section. Also, the
inspector should look for erosion in nonwaste areas that undermines roads and structures
causing a potential safety hazard or threatens the integrity of environmental control
systems.</p>

<p>When appropriate, the RWQCB and Department of Fish and Game should be alerted if
existing drainage structures for runon and runoff are plugged or otherwise inoperative or
when substantial amounts of sediment are observed leaving the site and entering waterways.
Sediment from erosion can also be harmful to fish in waterways.</p>

<h3><a name="Litter">Litter</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20830 Litter Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Litter shall be controlled, routinely collected and disposed of properly. Windblown
  materials shall be controlled to prevent injury to the public and personnel. Controls
  shall prevent the accumulation, or off-site migration, of litter in quantities that create
  a nuisance or cause other problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The off-site migration of litter should be considered a serious matter as it indicates
the operator&#146;s interest in running a compliant site that is not an eyesore or a
nuisance to neighbors or the public. However, blowing litter is a common occurrence at
some sites. A litter violation exists if litter has blown off site in objectionable
quantities or is allowed to accumulate excessively on site (e.g., piling up on fences, in
fence corners, or on vegetation).</p>

<p>The inspector should consider several factors when evaluating litter problems at
landfills. The litter that is created by the landfill should not be migrating off site.
Any material that has blown or migrated off site should be picked up as soon as is
practically possible by the operator. Litter associated with traffic coming to the
landfill, if there is any, should be cleaned up on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Control measures such as portable or permanent litter fences should be in place. If the
operator is having difficulty keeping litter under control there should be a litter crew
available on a temporary or permanent basis, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<p>If litter migration is an ongoing problem the compliance history of the site should be
reviewed to see if the operator has shown a good faith effort to remediate or prevent
litter problems. Some sites are poorly sited and due to regular windy conditions have
frequent off-site litter problems. Operators in such locations should be prepared to clean
up all migratory litter daily. If the operator is doing all that can be done a violation
may not be warranted. In such cases, perhaps a review of other operating procedures at the
site by the EA along with the operator, such as the size of the working face or the fill
sequencing of the facility, would be in order. Other landfills may be located next to
sensitive receptors such as wetlands or rare habitat areas. Again, it is the
operator&#146;s responsibility to prevent the impacts from the landfill from becoming a
problem for any neighboring property.</p>

<p>For many landfills litter is one of the biggest problems. When evaluating litter
control the inspector should consider the following: 

<ul>
  <li>Is litter adequately controlled? Are there portable or permanent fences to prevent
    migration? Are operations being conducted at the toe of the landfill or in a sheltered
    area on windy days? Is daily cover applied and compacted?</li>
  <li>Is litter routinely picked up? Is there a regular litter crew? Is the frequency of
    litter pickup adequate to maintain compliance?</li>
  <li>Have complaints been filed with the EA or CIWMB or other agency? What is the compliance
    history?</li>
  <li>Is litter being scattered on public roads by landfill traffic?</li>
  <li>Has litter blown offsite onto roads or adjacent properties in quantities that cause
    problems?</li>
  <li>Has litter been allowed to accumulate excessively, piling up on fences, fence corners,
    or on vegetation?</li>
  <li>Is the size of the working face and/or fill sequencing contributing to the litter
    problem?</li>
  <li>Is this a particularly windy site?</li>
  <li>Are sensitive receptors such as wetlands or rare habitat areas nearby?</li>
  <li>Is a large working face causing too much waste to be exposed to wind?<strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Noise">Noise</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 §CCR 20840 Noise Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Noise shall be controlled to prevent health and safety hazards to persons using the
  site and to nearby residents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This standard applies only to facility users and nearby residents, it does not apply to
site personnel. Concerns regarding noise hazards to site personnel should be brought to
the attention of Cal-OSHA's Department of Occupational Safety and Health. A violation of
this standard should be noted if noise in any area of the permitted site is hazardous
(i.e., can cause hearing damage) to persons using the site or to residents living nearby.</p>

<p>When unsafe noise levels are suspected at a facility the EA may request that CIWMB
staff evaluate noise levels. Measurements of noise levels will be performed with a Sound
Level Meter. Although noise standards enforced by Cal-OSHA (Table 1) apply exclusively to
site personnel, CIWMB staff recommend that these levels be referenced when making a noise
hazard determination under this standard.</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> 8 CCR noise standards, enforced by Cal-OSHA, require the employer to
administer a &quot;Hearing Conservation Program&quot; if an employee is exposed to the
action level [continuous 8 hours at 85 dBA (Time-Weighted Average)]. In this case, hearing
protectors should be made available to site personnel. Cal-OSHA standards are listed in
Table 1. Site personnel should not be exposed to impulsive or impact noise that exceeds a
peak sound pressure level of 140 dBA. Be aware that 8 CCR does not apply to federal
facilities.<strong></p>

<h3><a name="Traffic">Traffic</a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20860 Traffic Control</p>

</strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Traffic flow into, on, and out of the disposal site shall be controlled to minimize the
  following:</p>
  <p>(1) interference and safety problems for traffic on adjacent public streets or roads;</p>
  <p>(2) on-site safety hazards</p>
  <p>(3) interference with site operations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At no time should the traffic patterns on site constitute a safety problem for the
public using the facility. Facility personnel should be in complete control of vehicles
using the disposal area. The inspector should pay special attention to the traffic
patterns of heavy equipment on site that may be using seemingly deserted roads, but that
pose a special and significant hazard to facility staff and the public. Landfills often
have subcontractors on site who are driving large earthmovers or scrapers.</p>

<p>These huge vehicles tend to be driven very fast as the subcontractors are usually in a
hurry to finish the job and pose a particular danger to those who might be unaware of
their presence.</p>

<p>The inspector should consider the following when evaluating traffic problems or safety
hazards: 

<ul>
  <li>Are there barriers and signs present?</li>
  <li>Are the instructions clear?</li>
  <li>Are the signs legible?</li>
  <li>Are all turns to separate unloading areas marked?</li>
  <li>Is a spotter present? </li>
  <li>Are speed limits or restrictions posted?</li>
  <li>Are facility users prevented from entering unauthorized or unsafe areas?</li>
</ul>

<p>Concerns regarding vehicle stacking should be referred to the local traffic authority
or police.</p>

<h3><a name="SpecialWastes">Special Wastes </a><strong><i></h3>

<p></i>27 CCR §20870 Hazardous Wastes</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Owners or operators of all MSWLF units must implement a program at the facility for
  detecting and preventing the disposal of regulated hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR
  Part 261 and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) wastes as defined in 40 CFR Part 761. This
  program must include, at a minimum:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) Random inspections of incoming loads unless the owner or operator takes other steps
    to ensure that incoming loads do not contain regulated hazardous wastes or PCB wastes;</p>
    <p>(2) Records of any inspections;</p>
    <p>(3) Training of facility personnel to recognize regulated hazardous waste and PCB
    wastes; and</p>
    <p>(4) Notification of the EA, the Director of the California Department of Toxic
    Substances Control (DTSC), or its delegated agent, and the Regional Water Quality Control
    Board (RWQCB), if a regulated hazardous waste or PCB waste is discovered at the facility.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This standard requires owners/operators to conduct random inspections, as determined by
the operator, of incoming loads in order to prevent the disposal of regulated hazardous
wastes and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The inspector must verify that the operator
has a hazardous waste detection and prevention program and that it is being implemented.
Additionally, all inspection records, training procedures, and notification procedures
required by this standard are required to be placed in the operating record,
§20515&#150;Recordkeeping Requirements.</p>

<p>Training of facility personnel should emphasize methods to identify containers and
labels typical of hazardous and PCB wastes. It should address hazardous waste handling
procedures, safety precautions, and record keeping requirements. Adequate training may be
provided through a private contractor, LEA, DTSC, the Solid Waste Association of North
America (SWANA), or a university that has a curriculum specializing in identification and
handling of hazardous wastes.</p>

<p>When illegal hazardous waste is discovered the operator should isolate the material and
contact the appropriate county hazardous materials unit. The operator should attempt to
determine the source of the material. Many landfills have hazardous waste storage units.
If the waste does not present an immediate threat it should be properly stored in
accordance with 22 CCR requirements at this location. If hazardous waste is seen in the
working face or other unpermitted areas of the site, it is a violation unless it is also
seen by the operator who then takes appropriate action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>(b) A site shall not accept hazardous wastes unless the site has been
  approved for the particular waste involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inspector must verify that receipt of any hazardous material has been approved by
the appropriate agency. Questions regarding specific materials should be discussed with
DTSC.</p>

<p>Except for waste containing more than 1 percent friable asbestos, no waste that is
defined as hazardous waste and not excluded under 22 CCR Sections 66261.2, 66261.3, and
66261.4 (Appendix F) may be legally disposed at a Class III landfill. Illegal receipt or
storage of hazardous waste should be brought to the attention of the DTSC or the local
agency that is responsible for the implementation of the hazardous waste program. Some
examples of household hazardous wastes that may be found at solid waste (Class II or III)
disposal sites include used motor oil, latex and solvent-based paints, paint thinners,
batteries, antifreeze, and medical waste.</p>

<p>Also to be considered by the inspector are federal requirements that address special
requirements for hazardous waste generated by conditionally exempt small quantity
generators (Appendix G).</p>

<p>Hazardous wastes that are received and separated from the waste stream must be handled
with the proper precautions to protect site personnel, the public, or animals until
disposed of properly. These include adequate packaging, labeling and secure storage until
removal, appropriate personal protective equipment, and adequate personnel decontamination
facilities.</p>

<p>Regulated hazardous waste does not include household hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes
may be gases, liquids, solids, or sludges that are listed or exhibit the characteristics
in 40 CFR Part 261. PCB wastes may be liquid or nonliquid (sludges or solids) and are
defined in 40 CFR Section 761.60. PCB wastes do not include small capacitors found in
fluorescent light ballast, white goods, or other consumer electrical products. Fluorescent
light ballasts manufactured after January 1, 1978 do not contain PCBs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p></i>(c) At sites where hazardous materials are processed, precautions must be
  taken to eliminate or control dusts fumes, mists, vapors or gases that may be produced in
  quantities and under conditions which may have harmful effects on site personnel, the
  general public or animals.</p>
</blockquote>

  <strong>

<p>Oil.</strong> Concerns regarding oil storage and spillage should be brought to the attention
of the appropriate agency (DTSC and/or RWQCB).</p>
<i><strong>

<p>Note:</strong></i> Up to 5,000 gallons of used oil may be legally stored for up to 90 days
with proper secondary containment without having a permit as a hazardous waste storage
facility in accordance with Health and Safety Code §25123.3 and 22 CCR §66262.34. Tank
systems must comply with secondary containment requirements of 22 CCR §66265.193, unless
exempted in accordance with §66265.193(g) or granted a variance under §66265.193(g)
(Appendix H).</p>

<p>Used oil filters may be managed as nonhazardous waste only if the conditions set forth
in 22 CCR §66266.130 are met (Appendix I).</p>
<strong>

<p>Batteries.</strong> If a hazardous waste facilities permit is issued to the facility by the
DTSC batteries should be stored in accordance with its requirements. A hazardous waste
facilities permit may not be required if, in accordance with Health and Safety Code
§25218.8, up to one ton of used lead-acid batteries (approximately 50 batteries) are
stored for a maximum of one year or more than one ton of such batteries are stored for up
to 180 days (Appendix J). For estimating purposes the industry standard is 40 pounds per
battery. All batteries should be stored in accordance with 22 CCR requirements.</p>
<strong>

<p>Empty Pesticide Bags.</strong> Please see LEA Advisory #29 for guidance on handling the
disposal of empty pesticide bags. <strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20880 Medical Wastes (new) </p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medical waste, unless treated and deemed to be solid waste, which is regulated pursuant
  to the Medical Waste Management Act [part 14 (commencing with Section 117600) of Division
  104 of the Health and Safety Code], shall not be accepted for disposal at a site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Medical waste may be treated by incineration, steam sterilization (autoclave),
extremely high temperatures (greater than 1300 degrees Fahrenheit), or by other methods
approved by the Department of Health Services (DHS). Indicators of treatment may be
changes in color or substance of the container bag or changes in indicator tape placed on
the bag. It will be helpful to know what method is used by the medical waste generators
and/or hospitals in the area. Yet, it may still be impossible to determine if medical
waste has been either treated, or treated properly, especially if the bags have broken
open.</p>

<p>Medical waste generated by home health care can include dressings and bandages,
hypodermic needles, diapers, and medicines. Given the increasing effort to take patients
out of the hospital and back into their homes as soon as possible, and the increase in
home care for terminally ill patients, such as those with AIDS, more wastes are being
generated at home where there is no predisposal treatment available. Thus, there is a
likelihood that a worker at a material recovery facility (MRF) or landfill may come into
contact with biohazardous or sharps waste. At present patients are encouraged to double
bag dressings that may contain blood and body fluids and to place hypodermics in rigid
containers such as coffee cans or plastic bottles with caps and place the containers in
with the household garbage.</p>

<p>The EA may implement the Medical Waste Management Act through its medical waste
program; otherwise, the DHS will act as the enforcement agency. However, even if DHS is
the enforcement agency for medical waste the EA should have some protocol for following
when untreated medical waste is found or suspected at a MSWLF.</p>

<p>DHS recommends the following steps for proper handling of untreated medical waste at
landfills: 

<ol>
  <li>Attempt to identify the source of the medical waste.</li>
  <li>If a generator can be identified contact them to arrange for removal, treatment, and
    disposal, and report the incident to DHS if that agency is the enforcement agency.</li>
  <li>If no generator can be identified have the medical waste covered and compacted. Do not
    remove it for treatment or disposal at another site.</li>
</ol>

<p>See <strong>Appendix K</strong> for applicable sections from the Health and Safety Code defining
terms in this section and acceptable treatment methods for medical waste.<strong><i></p>

<p></i>27 CCR §20890 Dead Animals</p>

    </strong>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dead animals may be accepted if allowed by local regulations and shall be covered
