<h2>Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations</h2>

<strong>

<p>§261.5&#151;Special requirements for hazardous waste generated by conditionally exempt
    small quantity generators</p>

</strong>

    <p>(a) A generator is a conditionally exempt small quantity generator 
in a calendar month if he generates no more than 100 kilograms of 
hazardous waste in that month.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
    (b) Except for those wastes identified in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), 
and (j) of this section, a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator's hazardous wastes are not subject to regulation under parts 
262 through 266, 268, and parts 270 and 124 of this chapter, and the 
notification requirements of section 3010 of RCRA, provided the 
generator complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f), (g), and (j) 
of this section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (c) When making the quantity determinations of this part and 40 CFR 
part 262, the generator must include all hazardous waste that it 
generates, except hazardous waste that:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (1) Is exempt from regulation under 40 CFR 261.4(c) through (f), 
261.6(a)(3), 261.7(a)(1), or 261.8; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (2) Is managed immediately upon generation only in on-site 
elementary neutralization units, wastewater treatment units, or totally 
enclosed treatment facilities as defined in 40 CFR 260.10; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (3) Is recycled, without prior storage or accumulation, only in an 
on-site process subject to regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2); or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (4) Is used oil managed under the requirements of 40 CFR 261.6(a)(4) 
and 40 CFR part 279; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (5) Is spent lead-acid batteries managed under the requirements of 
40 CFR part 266, subpart G; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (6) Is universal waste managed under 40 CFR 261.9 and 40 CFR part 
273.
    (d) In determining the quantity of hazardous waste generated, a 
generator need not include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (1) Hazardous waste when it is removed from on-site storage; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (2) Hazardous waste produced by on-site treatment (including 
reclamation) of his hazardous waste, so long as the hazardous waste that 
is treated was counted once; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (3) Spent materials that are generated, reclaimed, and subsequently 
reused on-site, so long as such spent materials have been counted once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (e) If a generator generates acute hazardous waste in a calendar 
month in quantities greater than set forth below, all quantities of that 
acute hazardous waste are subject to full regulation under parts 262 
through 266, 268, and parts 270 and 124 of this chapter, and the 
notification requirements of section 3010 of RCRA:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (1) A total of one kilogram of acute hazardous wastes listed in 
Secs. 261.31, 261.32, or 261.33(e).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (2) A total of 100 kilograms of any residue or contaminated soil, 
waste, or other debris resulting from the clean-up of a spill, into or 
on any land or water, of any acute hazardous wastes listed in 
Secs. 261.31, 261.32, or 261.33(e).
    [Comment: ``Full regulation'' means those regulations applicable to 
generators of greater than 1,000 kg of non-acutely hazardous waste in a 
calendar month.]&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (f) In order for acute hazardous wastes generated by a generator of 
acute hazardous wastes in quantities equal to or less than those set 
forth in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section to be excluded from 
full regulation under this section, the generator must comply with the 
following requirements:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (1) Section 262.11 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (2) The generator may accumulate acute hazardous waste on-site. If 
he accumulates at any time acute hazardous wastes in quantities greater 
than those set forth in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, all 
of those accumulated wastes are subject to regulation under parts 262 
through 266, 268, and parts 270 and 124 of this chapter, and the 
applicable notification requirements of section 3010 of RCRA. The time 
period of Sec. 262.34(a) of this chapter, for accumulation of wastes on-
site, begins when the accumulated wastes exceed the applicable exclusion 
limit;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (3) A conditionally exempt small quantity generator may either treat 
or dispose of his acute hazardous waste in an on-site facility or ensure 
delivery to an off-site treatment, storage, or disposal facility, either 
of which, if located in the U.S., is:

[[Page 52]]&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    (i) Permitted under part 270 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (ii) In interim status under parts 270 and 265 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (iii) Authorized to manage hazardous waste by a State with a 
hazardous waste management program approved under part 271 of this 
chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (iv) Permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage 
municipal solid waste and, if managed in a municipal solid waste 
landfill is subject to Part 258 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (v) Permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage non-
municipal non-hazardous waste and, if managed in a non-municipal non-
hazardous waste disposal unit after January 1, 1998, is subject to the 
requirements in Secs. 257.5 through 257.30 of this chapter; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (vi) A facility which:
    (A) Beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimately recycles or 
reclaims its waste; or
    (B) Treats its waste prior to beneficial use or reuse, or legitimate 
recycling or reclamation; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (vii) For universal waste managed under part 273 of this chapter, a 
universal waste handler or destination facility subject to the 
requirements of part 273 of this chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (g) In order for hazardous waste generated by a conditionally exempt 
small quantity generator in quantities of less than 100 kilograms of 
hazardous waste during a calendar month to be excluded from full 
regulation under this section, the generator must comply with the 
following requirements:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (1) Section 262.11 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (2) The conditionally exempt small quantity generator may accumulate 
hazardous waste on-site. If he accumulates at any time more than a total 
of 1000 kilograms of his hazardous wastes, all of those accumulated 
wastes are subject to regulation under the special provisions of part 
262 applicable to generators of between 100 kg and 1000 kg of hazardous 
waste in a calendar month as well as the requirements of parts 263 
through 266, 268, and parts 270 and 124 of this chapter, and the 
applicable notification requirements of section 3010 of RCRA. The time 
period of Sec. 262.34(d) for accumulation of wastes on-site begins for a 
conditionally exempt small quantity generator when the accumulated 
wastes exceed 1000 kilograms;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (3) A conditionally exempt small quantity generator may either treat 
or dispose of his hazardous waste in an on-site facility or ensure 
delivery to an off-site treatment, storage or disposal facility, either 
of which, if located in the U.S., is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (i) Permitted under part 270 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (ii) In interim status under parts 270 and 265 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (iii) Authorized to manage hazardous waste by a State with a 
hazardous waste management program approved under part 271 of this 
chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (iv) Permitted, licensed, or registered by a State to manage 
municipal solid waste and, if managed in a municipal solid waste 
landfill is subject to Part 258 of this chapter;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
    (vii) For universal waste managed under part 273 of this chapter, a 
universal waste handler or destination facility subject to the 
requirements of part 273 of this chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (h) Hazardous waste subject to the reduced requirements of this 
section may be mixed with non-hazardous waste and remain subject to 
these reduced requirements even though the resultant mixture exceeds the 
quantity limitations identified in this section, unless the mixture 
meets any of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in 
subpart C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (i) If any person mixes a solid waste with a hazardous waste that 
exceeds a quantity exclusion level of this section, the mixture is 
subject to full regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    (j) If a conditionally exempt small quantity generator's wastes are 
mixed with used oil, the mixture is subject to

[[Page 53]]

part 279 of this chapter if it is destined to be burned for energy 
recovery. Any material produced from such a mixture by processing, 
blending, or other treatment is also so regulated if it is destined to
