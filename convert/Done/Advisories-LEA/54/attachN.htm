<h2>Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Protection of Environment, Part 258, Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills</h2>

    <strong>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">§ 258.1 Purpose, scope, and applicability.</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) The purpose of this part is to establish minimum national criteria
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or the Act), as amended, for all
municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) units and under the Clean Water Act, as amended,
for municipal solid waste landfills that are used to dispose of sewage sludge. These
minimum national criteria ensure the protection of human health and the environment.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) These Criteria apply to owners and operators of new MSWLF units,
existing MSWLF units, and lateral expansions, except as otherwise specifically provided in
this part; all other solid waste disposal facilities and practices that are not regulated
under Subtitle C of RCRA are subject to the criteria contained in part 257 of this
chapter.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) These Criteria do not apply to municipal solid waste landfill units
that do not receive waste after October 9, 1991.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)(1) MSWLF units that meet the conditions of 258.1(e)(2) and receive
waste after October 9, 1991 but stop receiving waste before April 9, 1994, are exempt from
all the requirements of this part 258, except the final cover requirement specified in §
258.60(a). The final cover must be installed by October 9, 1994. Owners or operators of
MSWLF units described in this paragraph that fail to complete cover installation by
October 9, 1994 will be subject to all the requirements of this part 258, unless otherwise
specified.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) MSWLF units that meet the conditions of § 258.1(e)(3) and receive
waste after October 9, 1991 but stop receiving waste before the date designated by the
state pursuant to 258.1(e)(3), are exempt from all the requirements of this part 258,
except the final cover requirement specified in § 258.60(a). The final cover must be
installed within one year after the date designated by the state pursuant to 258.1(e)(3).
Owners or operators of MSWLF units described in this paragraph that fail to complete cover
installation within one year after the date designated by the state pursuant to
258.1(e)(3) will be subject to all the requirements of this part 258, unless otherwise
specified.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) MSWLF units that meet the conditions of paragraph (f)(1) of this
section and receive waste after October 9, 1991 but stop receiving waste before October 9,
1997, are exempt from all the requirements of this part 258, except the final cover
requirement specified in § 258.60(a). The final cover must be installed by October 9,
1998. Owners or operators of MSWLF units described in this paragraph that fail to complete
cover installation by October 9, 1998 will be subject to all the requirements of this part
258, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4) MSWLF units that do not meet the conditions of 258.1 (e)(2),
(e)(3), or (f) and receive waste after October 9, 1991 but stop receiving waste before
October 9, 1993, are exempt from all the requirements this part 258, except the final
cover requirement specified in 258.60(a). The final cover must be installed by October 9,
1994. Owners or operators of MSWLF units described in this paragraph that fail to complete
cover installation by October 9, 1994 will be subject to all the requirements of this part
258, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)(1) The compliance date for all requirements of this part 258,
unless otherwise specified, is October 9, 1993 for all MSWLF units that receive waste on
or after October 9, 1993, except those units that qualify for an extension under (e)(2),
(3), or (4) of this section.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) The compliance date for all requirements of this part 258, unless
otherwise specified, is April 9, 1994 for an existing MSWLF unit or a lateral expansion of
an existing MSWLF unit that meets the following conditions:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i) The MSWLF unit disposed of 100 tons per day or less of solid waste
during a representative period prior to October 9, 1993;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii) The unit does not dispose of more than an average of 100 TPD of
solid waste each month between October 9, 1993 and April 9, 1994;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii) The MSWLF unit is located in a state that has submitted an
application for permit program approval to EPA by October 9, 1993, is located in the state
of Iowa, or is located on Indian Lands or Indian Country; and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv) The MSWLF unit is not on the National Priorities List (NPL) as
found in Appendix B to 40 CFR part 300.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) The compliance date for all requirements of this part 258, unless
otherwise specified, for an existing MSWLF unit or lateral expansion of an existing MSWLF
unit receiving flood-related waste from federally-designated areas within the major
disasters declared for the states of Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri,
Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota, and South Dakota by the President during the summer of
1993 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq., shall be designated by the state in which the
MSWLF unit is located in accordance with the following:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i) The MSWLF unit may continue to accept waste up to April 9, 1994
without being subject to part 258, if the state in which the MSWLF unit is located
determines that the MSWLF unit is needed to receive flood-related waste from a
federally-designated disaster area as specified in (e)(3) of this section.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii) The MSWLF unit that receives an extension under paragraph
(e)(3)(i) of this section may continue to accept waste up to an additional six months
beyond April 9, 1994 without being subject to part 258, if the state in which the MSWLF
unit is located determines that the MSWLF unit is needed to receive flood-related waste
from a federally-designated disaster area specified in (e)(3) of this section.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii) In no case shall a MSWLF unit receiving an extension under
paragraph (e)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section accept waste beyond October 9, 1994 without
being subject to part 258.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4) For a MSWLF unit that meets the conditions for the exemption in
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the compliance date for all applicable requirements of
part 258, unless otherwise specified, is October 9, 1997.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)(1) Owners or operators of new MSWLF units, existing MSWLF units,
and lateral expansions that dispose of less than twenty (20) tons of municipal solid waste
daily, based on an annual average, are exempt from subparts D and E of this part, so long
as there is no evidence of ground-water contamination from the MSWLF unit, and the MSWLF
unit serves:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i) A community that experiences an annual interruption of at least
three consecutive months of surface transportation that prevents access to a regional
waste management facility, or</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii) A community that has no practicable waste management alternative
and the landfill unit is located in an area that annually receives less than or equal to
25 inches of precipitation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) Owners or operators of new MSWLF units, existing MSWLF units, and
lateral expansions that meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this
section must place in the operating record information demonstrating this.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) If the owner or operator of a new MSWLF unit, existing MSWLF unit,
or lateral expansion has knowledge of ground-water contamination resulting from the unit
that has asserted the exemption in paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the
owner or operator must notify the state Director of such contamination and, thereafter,
comply with subparts D and E of this part.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g) Municipal solid waste landfill units failing to satisfy these
criteria are considered open dumps for purposes of State solid waste management planning
under RCRA.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(h) Municipal solid waste landfill units failing to satisfy these
criteria constitute open dumps, which are prohibited under section 4005 of RCRA.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i) Municipal solid waste landfill units containing sewage sludge and
failing to satisfy these Criteria violate sections 309 and 405(e) of the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(j) Subpart G of this part is effective April 9, 1995, except for MSWLF
units meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, in which case the
effective date of subpart G is October 9, 1995.</p>

<p><strong>§ 258.21 Cover material requirements.</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owners or
operators of all MSWLF units must cover disposed solid waste with six inches of earthen
material at the end of each operating day, or at more frequent intervals if necessary, to
control disease vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) Alternative materials of an alternative thickness (other than at
least six inches of earthen material) may be approved by the Director of an approved State
if the owner or operator demonstrates that the alternative material and thickness control
disease vectors, fires, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging without presenting a threat
to human health and the environment.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) The Director of an approved State may grant a temporary waiver from
the requirement of paragraph (a) and (b) of this section if the owner or operator
demonstrates that there are extreme seasonal climatic conditions that make meeting such
requirements impractical.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) The Director of an Approved State may establish alternative
frequencies for cover requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, after public
review and comment, for any owners or operators of MSWLFs that dispose of 20 tons of
municipal solid waste per day or less, based on an annual average. Any alternative
requirements established under this paragraph must:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) Consider the unique characteristics of small communities;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) Take into account climatic and hydrogeologic conditions; and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) Be protective of human health and the environment.</p>

<p><strong>§ 258.23 Explosive gases control.</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) Owners or operators of all MSWLF units must ensure that:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) The concentration of methane gas generated by the facility does not
exceed 25 percent of the lower explosive limit for methane in facility structures
(excluding gas control or recovery system components); and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) The concentration of methane gas does not exceed the lower
explosive limit for methane at the facility property boundary.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) Owners or operators of all MSWLF units must implement a routine
methane monitoring program to ensure that the standards of paragraph (a) of this section
are met.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) The type and frequency of monitoring must be determined based on
the following factors:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i) Soil conditions;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii) The hydrogeologic conditions surrounding the facility;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii) The hydraulic conditions surrounding the facility; and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv) The location of facility structures and property boundaries.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) The minimum frequency of monitoring shall be quarterly.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) If methane gas levels exceeding the limits specified in paragraph
(a) of this section are detected, the owner or operator must:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) Immediately take all necessary steps to ensure protection of human
health and notify the State Director;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) Within seven days of detection, place in the operating record the
methane gas levels detected and a description of the steps taken to protect human health;
and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) Within 60 days of detection, implement a remediation plan for the
methane gas releases, place a copy of the plan in the operating record, and notify the
State Director that the plan has been implemented. The plan shall describe the nature and
extent of the problem and the proposed remedy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(4) The Director of an approved State may establish alternative
schedules for demonstrating compliance with paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) For purposes of this section, lower explosive limit means the
lowest percent by volume of a mixture of explosive gases in air that will propagate a
flame at 25 &lt;&lt;degrees&gt;&gt; C and atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e) The Director of an Approved State may establish alternative
frequencies for the monitoring requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, after
public review and comment, for any owners or operators of MSWLFs that dispose of 20 tons
of municipal solid waste per day or less, based on an annual average. Any alternative
monitoring frequencies established under this paragraph must:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(1) Consider the unique characteristics of small communities;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) Take into account climatic and hydrogeologic conditions; and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(3) Be protective of human health and the environment.</p>
