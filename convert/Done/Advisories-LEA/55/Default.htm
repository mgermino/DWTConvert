    <h3>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</h3>

<p>This advisory provides guidance to Enforcement Agencies (EA) for implementing <a href="AttachA.htm">Title 27 emergency regulations concerning new federal Subtitle D
flexibilities</a> (Title 40,<i> </i>Code of Federal Regulations, Part 258), relating to
municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLF). It discusses the emergency regulations and
outlines the processes for EA implementation. It also outlines a process for operator
application for obtaining approval for alternative frequencies under these regulations.
These emergency regulations apply to MSWLFs receiving 20 tons or less of municipal solid
waste per day, based on an annual average. These regulations consider alternative
frequencies of application of daily cover and explosive gas monitoring. The regulations
became effective October 28, 1998, and are included as an attachment to this advisory.<strong></p>

<p>Title 27 Changes&#151;Description of New MSWLF Flexibilities for Alternative
Frequencies of Application of Daily Cover and Explosive Gas Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>The regulations in Title 27 have been amended as noted below: 

<ol>
  <strong>
  <li>Section 20060 &quot;Applicability of Federal Subtitle D Related Standards for Small
    Landfills&quot; </strong>has been amended to add subsection (b) which cross-references sections
    20680 and 20919.5, allowing alternative frequencies of application of daily cover and gas
    monitoring requirements.<strong><li>Section 20680 &quot;Daily Cover&quot;</strong> has been amended to add subsection (f) that
    allows the EA, with concurrence by the CIWMB, to establish alternative frequencies for
    application of daily cover.<strong><li>Section 20919.5 &quot;Explosive Gases Control</strong>&quot; has been amended to add
    subsection (f), which allows the EA, with concurrence by the CIWMB, to establish
    alternative frequencies for explosive gas monitoring.</li>
</ol>
<strong>

<h3>Procedure for Implementing Alternative Frequency of Application of Daily Cover and
Explosive Gas Monitoring</strong></h3>

<p>With these new flexibilities the EA may allow alternative frequencies of application of
daily cover and explosive gas monitoring after consideration of the unique characteristics
of small communities, climate and hydrogeologic conditions, and protection of human health
and the environment. Following are examples of these types of considerations. 

<ol>
  <li>Unique characteristics of small communities:<ol TYPE="a">
    <li>Alternative frequency of daily cover. <br />
      These characteristics may include small population with a low tax base, few practical
      alternatives, a landfill that serves a community that experiences an interruption of
      surface access, small amount of waste generated, and past history of the site.</li>
    <li>Alternative frequency of explosive gas monitoring. <br />
      Same as daily cover above.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Climatic and hydrogeologic conditions of the site:<ol TYPE="a">
    <li>Alternative frequency of daily cover.<br />
      Considerations include the distance from groundwater or surface water, gas or leachate
      generation, and rainfall and wind conditions.</li>
    <li>Alternative frequency of explosive gas monitoring.<br />
      Rainfall and resulting infiltration can increase the amount of gas generated.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Protection of human health and the environment:<ol TYPE="a">
    <li>Alternative frequency of daily cover.<br />
      Considerations include the extent to which the alternative frequency of cover will control
      vectors, fire, odors, blowing litter, and scavenging. The EA should consider the distance
      of the landfill from residences, agricultural lands and other receptors.</li>
    <li>Alternative frequency of explosive gas monitoring.<br />
      Considerations include previous detection of explosive gas and the distance of the
      landfill from residences, agricultural lands, and other receptors.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>A sample form (<a href="AttachB.htm">Attachment B</a>) has been developed that may be
used by EAs and CIWMB to document the approval of any alternative frequencies of daily
cover and/or explosive gas monitoring.</p>

<h3>Process for Obtaining Approval of Alternative Frequencies</h3>

<p>The following procedure may be followed in order to implement the alternative
frequencies of daily cover and gas monitoring:<i><strong></p>

<p>Operator</strong></i></p>

<p>The operator submits a request to the EA for alternative frequency. The request should
specify the current frequency, the requested frequency, and justification for the request.
The request should include the landfill's most recent year's annual average tonnage.<i><strong></p>

<p>EA 

<ol>
  </strong></i>
  <li>The EA verifies the average tonnage (20 tons or less per day based on an annual average)
    and addresses:<ol TYPE="a">
    <li>The unique characteristics of small communities.</li>
    <li>The climatic and hydrogeologic conditions of the site (CIWMB Closure, Remediation and
      Technical Assistance staff, other agencies, and consultants may be of help when reviewing
      the hydrogeologic aspects of the site).</li>
    <li>The protection of human health and the environment, which are described above.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>The EA provides for public review and comment. Any proposal to allow an alternative
    frequency requires public review for a minimum of 30 days to allow affected parties the
    opportunity to comment. This can be achieved by noticing the proposal in the local
    newspaper. Many EAs use their local governing body's notice and hearing process for issues
    requiring public notice.</li>
  <li>The EA sends a recommendation to their CIWMB Permitting and Inspection staff contact for
    concurrence.</li>
</ol>
<i><strong>

<p>CIWMB</strong></i></p>

<p>CIWMB staff reviews EA recommendations and submits evidence of concurrence or
non-concurrence back to the EA within 14 days.</p>

<p>A copy of the EA recommendation and CIWMB concurrence shall be placed in the operating
record. If the form presented as Attachment B is used the completed and signed copy should
be placed in the operating record.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Small MSWLFs that receive 20 tons or less of municipal solid waste per day, based on an
annual average, may qualify for alternative frequencies in application of daily cover and
explosive gas monitoring. EAs may use the above guidance in determining qualifying sites
and submit recommendations to the CIWMB. CIWMB Permitting and Inspection staff will review
the proposed alternatives and EA recommendation for concurrence. Documentation of the EA's
considerations, public comment, and CIWMB concurrence shall be placed in the operating
record.</p>
