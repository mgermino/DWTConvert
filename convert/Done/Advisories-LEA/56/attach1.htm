<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Based on several burn dump investigations California Integrated Waste Management Board
(IWMB) staff have determined that there may be elevated levels or hazardous levels of
arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc in the
soil/ash. Also, low levels of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons and/or low to
nondetectable levels of semivolatile organic compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB),
dioxins, and furans may be present in burn ash. The pH in the burn ash is expected to
range from 6.0 to 9.0. When waste characterization of a burn dump is necessary an
investigation must be performed to delineate the nature and extent of the waste and to
determine if the burn ash is a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous
waste, a non-RCRA hazardous waste (designated California hazardous waste), or a
nonhazardous solid waste. Once the waste classification is established, the appropriate
and effective remediation measures can be determined. To accomplish this objective the
burn ash should be sampled and analyzed using one or more of the testing protocols
describe below.</p>

<p>The IWMB&#146;s Solid Waste Cleanup Program (SWCP) has developed a waste
characterization methodology and actively evaluated burn dumps throughout California. The
SWCP considers a variety of factors in assessing burn dumps and recommends the following
procedures for the waste characterization. The components of the waste characterization
include: 

<ol>
  <li>Developing a sampling plan.</li>
  <li>Performing discrete sampling following a recommended sampling procedure.</li>
  <li>Analyzing samples using recommended analytical procedures and testing methodologies.</li>
  <li>Comparing sampling results with regulatory limits.</li>
</ol>

<p>The use of SWCP's waste characterization methodology is only a recommendation.
Depending on site conditions other city, county, State, or federal agencies may require
additional sampling, analyses, and assessments.</p>

<h2>Waste Characterization Methodology</h2>
<i>

<p><strong>Sampling Plan</i></strong></p>

<p>A sampling plan is necessary to document the procedural and analytical requirements to
collect soil samples to characterize areas of potential contamination from a burn dump.
The intent of the plan is to provide the necessary documentation to characterize the burn
dump ash. At a minimum the plan should discuss: site location and background, project
purpose, project tasks, methodology, equipment, sampling procedures and locations,
decontamination, sample containers and preservation, disposal of residual materials,
analyses of concern, analytical procedures, quality control, chain of custody, and health
and safety issues. The number of samples will vary depending on the size, location, and
site conditions.<i><strong></p>

<p>Sampling Methodology</strong></i></p>

<p>The SWCP staff use authoritative discrete sampling to assess the burn ash and
surrounding soils. Authoritative sampling is based on the subjective judgement of the
investigator regarding the location of potential contamination and serves as a valuable
investigative tool in ascertaining if a hazardous substance is or is not present.<i><strong></p>

<p>Sampling Procedures</strong></i></p>

<p>The SWCP uses appropriate sampling, collecting, decontamination, and storage
techniques. All environmental samples are sent to a state-certified hazardous waste
laboratory for analyses using chain-of-custody protocols.<i><strong></p>

<p>Testing Protocols</strong></i></p>

<p>In a waste characterization study burn ash samples are analyzed using one or more test
protocols. Each test protocol produces its own specific type of information for a given
range of conditions.</p>

<p>Four test protocols that are widely used are:</p>
<strong>

<p>Protocol 1:</strong> <strong>Totals Test.</strong> The &quot;totals test&quot; is a chemical digestion
test developed by the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to determine the total
amount of a specific constituent in the soil. A sample is digested chemically to obtain
its soluble and insoluble fractions. The total of the soluble and insoluble fractions of
the sample is then compared to the total threshold limit concentration (TTLC). The results
of the Totals Test are reported in milligrams per kilogram of sample (mg/kg).</p>
<strong>

<p>Protocol 2:</strong> <strong>Waste Extraction Test (WET).</strong> The WET is a leaching test
developed by DTSC. Results of the WET are compared to the Soluble Threshold Limit
Concentration (STLC). The WET determines the amount of a specific constituent that can be
leached from the soil using a solution designed to simulate landfill leaching. It is
therefore a useful test for situations where a soil would be exposed to landfill leachate,
such as disposal of ash together with uncombusted organic wastes in a solid waste
landfill. However, the WET may not be very representative of the conditions at a site
where all organic material has been completely burned. Because of the aggressive nature of
the leaching in this test samples may exceed the STLC. The results of the WET are reported
in milligrams per liter (mg/l).</p>
<strong>

<p>Protocol 3:</strong> <strong>Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP).</strong> The TCLP was
developed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to determine if a
waste is a RCRA waste subject to regulation under Subtitle C. The TCLP is a leaching
procedure that uses a slightly less aggressive leaching agent than is used by the WET. The
TCLP ensures that any volatile constituents present in the sample are collected and
measured. However, few volatile constituents are likely to be found in completely
combusted burn ash. Therefore, when compared to the WET results it is likely that TCLP
results will indicate lower metals concentrations and less elevated levels of volatile
constituents. Chromium is one of the few constituents that may be present in higher
concentrations in TCLP results than in WET results. Chromium concentrations are higher
because the TCLP results do not differentiate between the 3+ and 6+ chrome species, but
report the two species combined. In contrast, the WET reports the 3+ and 6+ species
separately. The results of the TCLP are reported in milligrams per liter (mg/l).
Temperatures reached during open burning are usually not high enough to completely combust
all waste materials in the burn ash. Therefore, in a worst case situation, incomplete
combustion may create dioxins and other organic compounds.</p>
<strong>

<p>Protocol 4: Deionized Water Waste Extraction Test (DI WET).</strong> The DI WET is used to
characterize the amount of metals that would leach from ash under the conditions most
likely to be encountered at burn dump sites. This test is essentially the same test as the
WET, but uses deionized water as the leaching agent. At most burn dump sites the primary
liquid that will come in contact with burn ash is water, not landfill leachate. Results of
tests done on samples of burn ash from a variety of burn dump sites indicate that very few
samples release any metals when tested under the DI WET protocol.<i><strong></p>

<p>Analytical Procedures</strong></i></p>

<p>Typically, all samples are analyzed for California Assessment Manual (CAM) 17 metals
using the Totals Test procedure by EPA Method 6010/7000 and pH by EPA Method 9040. Samples
(i.e., at least three) with the highest concentration of lead based on the Totals Test are
also analyzed for CAM-5 metals using the WET procedure and RCRA Eight Metals using the
TCLP. Also, if the WET results for any other metal not in the CAM-5 analysis exceeds 10
times the STLC regulatory level a separate WET analysis for that metal must be performed.
In addition, the IWMB use the highest lead samples and analyze again for lead using the DI
WET extraction procedure. Sampling for PCBs, total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons
(TRPH), and semi-volatile organic compounds may be necessary if visual observation or
records indicate possible contamination. </p>

<p>At minimum the SWCP staff recommends all soil/ash samples be analyzed for: 

<ul>
  <i>
  <li>CAM 17 Metals (Sb, As, Ba, Be, Ce, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Hg, Mo, Ni, Se, Ag, Tl, V, Zn) Totals
    Test, EPA Method 6010/7471</li>
  <li>pH, EPA Method 9040</i></li>
</ul>

<p>And<i> </i>the three samples containing the highest lead be analyzed for: 

<ul>
  <i>
  <li>CAM 5 Metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn), WET, EPA Method 6010</li>
  <li>TCLP RCRA Metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se), EPA Method 1311</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the LEA may request the following sampling procedures: 

<ul>
  <i>
  <li>PCBs, EPA Method 8080</li>
  <li>Total Recoverable Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TRPH), EPA Method 418.1</li>
  <li>Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds, EPA Method 8270</li>
  <li>Lead DI-WET, WET, EPA Method 6010</i></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, testing for dioxins and furans may be appropriate if evidence suggests
that these constituents would likely be present from the type of waste combusted, and/or
the site is located in an urban area with a number of sensitive receptors nearby and where
there is a higher risk to human health and safety.<i><strong></p>

<p>Regulatory Limits</strong></i></p>

<p>To characterize the ash, SWCP staff use regulatory limits established from the
California Code of Regulations, Title 22, section 66261.10 et seq. and the Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 40, Section 261.24. The sample results are compared to the TTLC and
STLC, and the federal RCRA Standards. This comparison provides the basis for classifying
the burn ash as either a RCRA hazardous waste, a non-RCRA hazardous waste (designated
California hazardous waste), or a non-hazardous solid waste. Burn ash that contains
concentrations of metals that exceed the TTLC or STLC limits, or established health based
levels that the DTSC has determined to be protective of human health and the environment,
may be considered hazardous waste as defined in Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
section 17225.32. In addition, wastes that exceed the TCLP concentration limits would be
considered a RCRA hazardous waste.</p>

<h2>Examples of Burn Ash Analytical Test Results in California</h2>

<p><a href="Table1.htm">Table 1</a> shows the highest concentrations from the totals test
data of nine common metals found in ash sampled at 12 sites throughout California. These
numbers represent the total amount of certain metals that are present in the soil. These
results show that ash commonly contains lead in excess of the California standard for
hazardous waste, with nickel and zinc also found at elevated levels. Some of the tested
sites also showed elevated levels of arsenic and chromium.</p>

<p><a href="Table2.htm">Table 2</a> compares the results of testing of a single sample
using the Totals Test, WET, TCLP, and DI WET test protocols. Samples tested under the
Totals Test protocol that exceed the TTLC hazardous threshold for lead also will likely
exceed the STLC hazardous threshold for lead. However, a sample tested under the TCLP
protocol, with its less aggressive leaching agent, will probably not exceed the hazardous
threshold concentration associated with the TCLP test. If the sample is tested under the
DI WET protocol the sample again probably will not exceed the STLC hazardous threshold
concentration limits.<strong></p>
