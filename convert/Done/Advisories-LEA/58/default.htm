<p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong>
</p>


<p>This advisory provides guidance               
to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) for implementing the &quot;three-part     
test&quot;               
(separated for reuse, 10 percent residual, and 1 percent putrescible) of the          
transfer/processing facilities and operations regulations. Regulations               
containing the first two parts of the test (separated for reuse and 10 percent               
residual) became effective on March 5, 1999, establishing in law what became               
known as the &quot;two-part test.&quot;&nbsp;Regulations containing the third part
of the test (1 percent          
putrescible) became effective under emergency regulations on February 13, 2002
and under permanent regulations on September 30, 2002, and               
created what is now known as the &quot;three-part test.&quot;&nbsp;Both sets of regulations can be               
found at California Code of Regulations, Title 14, (14 CCR) Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 6.0 et seq. (commencing               
at section 17400). Specifically,               
section 17402.5(d) sets forth the &quot;three-part test.&quot; It provides a test to               
determine whether an activity is considered to be a recycling center, and               
therefore, not subject to the California Integrated Waste Management Board               
(Board) regulations. <a href="3partflow.htm">Attachment 1</a> to this advisory is
a graphic summary of the three part test.</p>               

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Public      
Resources Code section 40200(b)(2) provides that the Board does not have      
jurisdiction over facilities whose primary function is to process wastes that      
have already been separated for reuse and are not intended for disposal. The transfer/processing facilities  
and operations regulations set forth a three-part test, which was established to help determine if a business      
qualifies for the exclusion from the Board’s jurisdiction. The three-part test provides a measurable method to allow for statewide consistency regarding      
regulatory exclusions. Outside of the Board’s jurisdiction, these businesses      
are not subject to LEA inspections or to solid waste operational standards      
established by the Board. Those sites that accept waste that is not &quot;source 
separate&quot; or &quot;separated for reuse&quot; and/or create more than a 10 percent residual of      
solid waste and/or contain more than 1 percent putrescible wastes are subject to the      
Board’s regulations. The Department of Conservation has authority to oversee      
the beverage container recycling operations in the state. </p>     

<p>Since the               
effective date of the regulations containing the two-part test there has               
been much discussion regarding the methodology of the two-part test. The               
Enforcement Advisory Council (EAC) passed resolution number 99-09 at their               
November 18, 1999, meeting that recommended the Board develop an advisory               
providing guidance to implement the two-part test.  With the adoption of emergency regulations for putrescible               
wastes, the EAC suggested the Board expand the advisory to include guidance on               
the implementation of the third part of the test.</p>               

<h2>Three-Part Test</h2>

<p>When an activity meets the three-part test to      
qualify as a recycling center, it is not subject to the Board’s regulations. If      
it fails any part of the three-part test, the activity is considered a solid      
waste operation or facility subject to the Board’s jurisdiction. </p>      

<h3>Part     
One of the Three-Part Test</h3>    

<p>The first part of the test is that an activity   
shall only receive material that has been separated for reuse prior to receipt   
(section 17402.5 (d)(1)). </p>   

<p>Separated   
for reuse material is defined in subsection (b)(3) as follows:</p>   

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Separated for Reuse&quot; means materials, including commingled recyclables, that 
have been separated or kept separate from the solid waste stream for the purpose 
of additional sorting or processing those materials for recycling or reuse in 
order to return them to the economic mainstream in the form of raw material for 
new, reused, or reconstituted products which meet the quality standards 
necessary to be used in the marketplace, and includes materials that have been 
&quot;source separated.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In    
other words the term &quot;separated for reuse&quot; would typically mean the final    
product sent to a recycling center after being processed by an intermediary (like    
a transfer/processing facility). &quot;Separated for reuse&quot; recyclable material    
could also include &quot;source separated&quot; recyclable material.</p>    

<p>Source   
separated material is defined in subsection (b)(4) as follows:</p>   

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Source Separated&quot; means materials, including     
commingled recyclables, that have been separated or kept separate from the     
solid waste stream, at the point of generation, for the purpose of additional     
sorting or processing those materials for recycling or reuse in order to return     
them to the economic mainstream in the form of raw material for new, reused, or     
reconstituted products which meet the quality standards necessary to be used in     
the marketplace. </p>    

</blockquote>

<p>The term &quot;source separated&quot; means the recyclable material    
that is separated at the point of generation and is sent to a recycler, which    
is analogous with a homeowner taking his/her recyclables to a recycler. &quot;Source    
separated&quot; recyclable material does not include &quot;separated for reuse&quot;    
recyclable material.</p>    

<p>
Methods for determining whether the material is source separated or separated 
for reuse include:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>Visit the site and observe operation. Look for load              
characteristics and separation of material. Does there appear to be a significant amount of solid waste mixed in              
with the loads?</li>            
  <li>   
Review the business’ contracts. Check language to see    
if it is restricted to separated for reuse material.</li> 
  <li>  
Obtain a copy of the pamphlets or handouts provided to   
customers.</li>
  <li>  
Check the bins at the generator site. Are there   
separate bins for the recyclable material and the solid waste?</li> 
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a) An              
activity that receives separated for reuse is a concrete recycling business              
that receives materials from a construction site that has designated bins on     
  site. The recycling bins on site are clearly differentiated (by labels or              
colors, etc.) from bins for solid waste.               
In this example, the facility receives separated for reuse material so              
it meets the first part of the test.</p>              

  <p>b) An    
activity that receives material from a hauler that picks up bins that are for    
everything generated on site including solid waste that is not separated for    
reuse. In this example, the activity receives solid waste not separated for    
reuse material so it does not meet the first part of the test.</p>    

</blockquote>
<p>Using the first part of the three-part test we can determine whether or not an activity is               
receiving material that is source separated or separated for               
reuse. If the operation is receiving mixed solid waste/material not separated for     
reuse, then it fails to meet the first part of the test and is               
within the Board’s jurisdiction, regardless of whether or not the entire               
operation's residual is less than 10 percent or less then 1 percent (part 2 and 3 of the     
three-part test). This part of the test was designed to distinguish an               
operation that is separating recyclables from solid waste from one that is               
handling already separated recyclable material only. If the activity meets the first part of the test, then proceed to               
the second part of the test. If it fails the first part, the activity is within               
the Board’s jurisdiction and the second and third parts of the test are not               
warranted.</p>

<h3>Part Two of the Three-Part Test</h3>    

<p>The second part of the test is the determination      
that the residual amount of solid waste in the material is less than 10 percent of the      
amount of separated for reuse material received by weight (section      
17402.5(d)(2)). The “10 percent residual” part of the test is intended to provide a      
minimal objective standard to supplement the more subjective first part of the      
test (and statute). The allowance for 10 percent residual is recognition of the fact      
that it is not uncommon for materials that are legitimately separated for      
reuse to still include minimal levels of contamination. </p>      

<p>Residual is defined in subsection 17402.5(b)(1)   
as follows:</p>   

<blockquote>

<p>(1) “Residual” means the solid waste destined for disposal, further      
transfer/processing as defined in section 17402(a)(30) or (31), or      
transformation which remains after processing has taken place and is calculated      
in percent as the weight divided by the total incoming weight of materials.</p>     

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Calculating    
and Estimating the 10 Percent Residual</strong></p>    

<p>The percentage of residual waste is calculated   
by:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="70%" align="center"><u>_______Total weight of residual per one month&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      ____&nbsp;<br />
      </u>Total weight of incoming material per the same month</td>            
    <td width="10%" align="center">X 100</td> 
    <td width="20%" align="center">= Percent residual</td> 
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For example: A facility receives 150 tons of    
separated for reuse material in the month of May 2000 and 20 tons of the 150 is    
residual. Therefore the facility has a percent residual of 13 percent.</p>   

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="70%" align="center"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            
      20 tons of residual for the month of May____</u>__<br />           
      150 tons material received in the month of May</td>           
    <td width="10%" align="center">X 100</td> 
    <td width="20%" align="center"> = »13 percent residual</td>           
  </tr>
</table>

<p>1) The residual amount is calculated by measuring   
the outgoing tonnage after separated for reuse materials have been removed.   
This is determined on a monthly basis based on the number of operating days.</p>   

<p>2)&nbsp;The              
recycling center may include an adjustment in the calculation to include the              
weight of water in the residual, when the use of water is essential to the              
processing of the material, provided that such an adjustment is also made in              
the weight of materials received for processing. Some wood recyclers use this              
adjustment.</p>

<p>3)&nbsp;The following materials shall not be included as part of the              
outgoing residual when calculating the percent of residual, if the recycling              
activities are separated from the material handling activities noted below by a              
defined physical barrier or where the activities are otherwise separated in a              
manner that the LEA determines will keep the materials from being commingled: </p>              

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">a)&nbsp;materials received at an on-site buy-back center </p>             

  <p align="left">b)&nbsp;materials received at an on-site drop-off center </p>             

  <p align="left">c)&nbsp;cannery waste </p>             

  <p align="left">d) construction    
and demolition materials </p>   

  <p align="left">e)&nbsp;nonhazardous contaminated soil</p>             

  <p align="left">f)&nbsp;grease-trap pumpings </p>              

  <p align="left">g)&nbsp;nonhazardous asbestos </p>             

  <p align="left">h)&nbsp;nonhazardous ash </p>             

  <p align="left">i)&nbsp;compost and compost feedstock </p>             

  <p align="left">j)&nbsp;sewage sludge </p>             

  <p>k)&nbsp;tires</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The foregoing provision does not exclude the handling of materials listed in subdivisions (d)(6)(C) through (K) from being subject to other regulations of the Board, it only sets forth whether or not they are to be included in the calculation of the percentage of residual for the purposes of this section. The handling of nonhazardous contaminated soil is subject to section 17360 et seq. The handling of nonhazardous asbestos is subject to section 17897 et seq. The handling of nonhazardous ash is subject to section 17367 et seq. The handling of compost and compost feedstock is subject to section 17850 et seq. The handling of tires is subject to section 18420 et seq. The handling of other materials listed in this subdivision is subject to section 17400 et seq. unless otherwise specified (section 17402.5(d)(6)).</p>
<p>Which means, unless the activity for the handling of the specified material qualifies as a recycling center, the handling of these types of materials will be subject to the Board’s regulations either as a transfer/processing operation or facility, or under a separate regulatory package, but not under the definition of a recycling center.  Materials from the list received at a regulated site (e.g., transfer/processing operation or facility) shall count toward the regulatory tier tonnage/volume limits for that site.  Materials from the list that are received at a site that qualifies as a recycling center shall not be used to calculate the percent residual to meet the
three-part test.</p>

<p>The LEA should   
consider the following when evaluating an alternative to a physical barrier: </p>   

<ul>
  <li>The   
barrier should be adequate to completely separate both operations.</li> 
  <li>Physical   
proximity of the operations. Does the distance between the operations   
constitute a clear separation?</li> 
  <li>Whether    
processing areas, equipment, and personnel are shared by the facilities. If    
equipment and personnel are shared, it could imply a single operation.</li>  
  <li>Whether   
environmental controls are shared.</li> 
  <li>Whether    
record-keeping is shared. If shared, indicates likelihood of a single operation.</li>  
  <li>Protection   
of public health, safety, and the environment. Does the alternative barrier   
prevent a threat to public health and the environment?</li> 
  <li>The   
intent of the operator.</li> 
</ul>

<p>An alternative to a physical barrier would need   
to be more than just a line on the floor or cones, etc. Alternatives may   
include a separate building, an operation located at opposite ends of a parcel,   
etc.</p>

<p><a href="#Attachments">Attachment 2</a> contains a comparison chart that              
can be used as a visual tool to estimate the percentage composition of              
contaminants in a material. The chart              
contains diagrams representing a range of percentage compositions. By comparing the diagrams to a              
representative sample of the host material, the user can visually determine              
which diagram best matches the sample. The chart is based on percent by volume, so to use it to determine              
percent by weight, the user will need some idea of the relative densities of              
the contaminants and the host material. </p>              

<p>If the activity meets the second part of the     
test, then proceed to the third part of the test. If it fails the second part, the activity is within the Board’s     
jurisdiction and the third part of the test is not warranted.</p>     

<h3>Part Three of the Three-Part Test</h3>    

<p>The third part of the test is the determination that the               
amount of putrescible wastes in the separated for reuse material is less than 1 percent of the amount of separated for reuse material received by
weight and the putrescible wastes in the separated for reuse material shall not
cause a nuisance, as determined by the EA (section               
17402.5 (d)(3)). The “1 percent putrescible”               
part of the test provides additional objectivity to supplement the subjective               
first part of the test (and statute). The restriction of 1 percent putrescible     
wastes is recognition of the fact that putrescible wastes can pose a               
significant risk to public health, safety, and the environment and, therefore,               
any site receiving putrescible wastes should be regulated.  The regulation allows up to     
1 percent putrescible wastes rather than taking a zero tolerance stance because it is not uncommon               
for materials that are legitimately separated for reuse to still               
include minimal levels of putrescible wastes. </p>               

<p>The “creation of nuisance” part of the test provides an EA with additional flexibility.  A business must pass all parts of the test to qualify as a Recycling Center; therefore, failure of any part makes the business subject to regulation.   This part of the test may be particularly useful when the percentage of putrescible wastes cannot be accurately measured. </p>               

<p>Examples: </p>               

<ol>
  <li type="a">A business receiving 3 percent putrescible wastes that is not causing a nuisance fails the test based on the percentage of putrescible wastes.</li>
  <li type="a">A business receiving 0.75 percent putrescible wastes that is causing a nuisance fails the test based on the creation of nuisance.</li>
</ol>

<p>Putrescible wastes is defined in subsection 17402(a)(21) as follows:</p> 

<blockquote>

<p>“Putrescible wastes” include wastes that are      
capable of being decomposed by microorganisms with sufficient rapidity as to      
cause nuisances because of odors, vectors, gases or other offensive conditions,      
and include materials such as, but not limited to food wastes, offal and dead 
animals.  The EA shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether or not a site is handling putrescible wastes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nuisance is defined in subsection 17402(a)(12) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nuisance” includes anything which:</p>

  <ol>
    <li type="A">is injurious to human health or is indecent or offensive to the senses and interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, and</li>
    <li type="A">affects at the same time an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons.  The extent of annoyance or damage inflicted upon an individual may be unequal.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The LEA shall determine on a case-by-case basis              
whether or not a site is handling putrescible wastes. Although the regulatory definition lists some examples, it is              
difficult to produce an inclusive list of putrescible wastes. If the site proposes to handle or is              
handling wastes not explicitly listed in the definition, the LEA should use its              
experience to determine whether the waste stream is capable of causing a              
nuisance or other offensive condition. The rates at which microorganisms decompose materials (and the              
likelihood that this will result in odor, vectors, etc.) are highly dependent              
on the characteristics of the material (e.g., particle size, moisture content,              
nitrogen content, sugar content, bulk density, fat content), and on management              
practices, which vary widely. For              
example, materials high in nitrogen, sugars, and/or fats (e.g., fruits, meats)              
have a higher capability to become putrid. Higher moisture content and smaller particle sizes will decrease pore              
spaces for oxygen, possibly leading to anaerobic conditions, which can also              
cause odors. An operator can control              
some of these variables with proper management practices at a site, but may              
need to work diligently with haulers and contracting agencies that oversee collection           
programs to avoid receiving waste that is              
already in a putrid or anaerobic state when delivered to the facility.</p>              

<p><strong>Calculating    
and Estimating 1 Percent Putrescible Wastes</strong></p>    

<p>The amount   
of putrescible wastes is calculated on a monthly basis based on the number of   
operating days, as follows:</p>   

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="70%" align="center"><u>&nbsp; _____ Total weight of putrescible wastes per one month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      ___&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 </u>  
Total weight of incoming separated for reuse material in same month</td>            
    <td width="10%" align="center">X 100</td> 
    <td width="20%" align="center"> = Percent putrescible wastes</td> 
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For example: A facility receives 200 tons of    
separated for reuse material in the month of August 2000 and 10 tons of the 200    
is putrescible wastes. Therefore the facility received 5 percent putrescible wastes.</p>    

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="70%" align="center"><u>       10 
tons of putrescible wastes for the month of August       &nbsp;<br />
 </u> 200              
tons of separated for reuse material received in August</td>            
    <td width="10%" align="center">X 100</td> 
    <td width="20%" align="center"> = 5 percent putrescible    
wastes</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The               
regulations do not require the operator to physically separate putrescible               
wastes from each load of separated reuse materials for the purpose of               
calculating the amount of putrescible wastes received. Rather, the operator can visually estimate               
the amount of putrescible wastes in each load. If the LEA has reason to believe that the operator’s estimates are not               
accurate, the LEA may request additional proof, such as removing, weighing, and               
recording the amount of putrescible wastes contained in a representative               
sampling of incoming loads.</p>               

<p><a href="#Attachments">Attachment 2</a> contains a comparison chart that              
can be used as a visual tool to estimate the percentage composition of              
contaminants in a material. The chart              
contains diagrams representing a range of percentage compositions. By comparing the diagrams to a              
representative sample of the host material, the user can visually determine              
which diagram best matches the sample. The chart is based on percent by volume, so to use it to determine              
percent by weight, the user will need some idea of the relative densities of              
the contaminants and the host material. </p>              

<h3>Burden   
of Proof</h3>   

<p>The burden of proof rests with the owner or     
operator to demonstrate that the three-part test is being met in the     
following situations:</p>     

<p>1.&nbsp;If              
the LEA has information (i.e. via a complaint, newspaper article, visual              
inspection, etc.) that material being received is not separated for reuse,              
that the residual is 10 percent or more of the total incoming material weight per
month, or the amount of putrescible wastes is 1 percent or more of the total per
month.</p>

<p>2. If the LEA has reason to believe that a    
business is accepting material that is not separated for    
reuse due to the averaging or combining of those loads with other loads of separated for    
reuse material. If review of the records indicates materials from a particular    
account have over 10 percent residual in    
their loads, the business would fail the second part of the test. The business    
is considered to be accepting loads that are not separated for reuse if it    
continues to receive from this account. The business must stop accepting from    
that account, educate that account so that material must be separated for    
reuse, or get a permit if they choose to continue its acceptance. </p>    

<p>3.&nbsp;If the EA has reason to believe that a business is accepting material that is not separated for reuse or source separated due to the separation of portions of the material at consecutive sites, each of which removes less than 10 percent residual, the business is considered to be accepting loads that are not separated for reuse and, therefore, would fail the second part of the test, if the residual in the load accepted and processed at the first of consecutive sites were greater than 10 percent. The business must stop accepting these loads or get a permit if they choose to continue.</p>               

<p>4. While               
recycling centers are not within the Board’s jurisdiction and are therefore not               
subject to specific record-keeping requirements, these businesses may want to               
maintain adequate documentation or other evidence to show that the activity is               
a recycling center and not a transfer/processing operation or facility. The regulations provide a process for               
voluntary record-keeping which businesses may want to use to prevent concerns               
regarding their status and activities. A business may report their residual               
percentage to the LEA using form CIWMB 607 (<a href="../../forms/ciwmb607.pdf">PDF</a>:   
Adobe Acrobat, 16 KB or <a href="../../forms/ciwmb607.doc">Word</a>: 97, 27 KB). An alternative report may be used               
which easily and clearly identifies the residual amounts and documents that               
only separated for reuse material is received. Adequate documentation will               
include information regarding total weight of material received, total weight               
of residual, total amount of material separated for reuse, and if possible the               
accounts with their residual amounts.</p>               

<p>At the time that the LEA requires a recycling   
center to provide evidence that it is in compliance with this subdivision, the   
LEA shall provide the recycling center with a written description of the   
information that has caused the LEA to believe that the recycling center is not   
in compliance. </p>   

<p>If the LEA is unable to make a determination      
from the records supplied by the operator of whether it meets the three-part 
test, then the LEA can issue a notice and order. The notice and order will      
cause the operation to cease until the operator:</p>      

<p>1)&nbsp;obtains              
the appropriate tiered permit; or </p>              

<p>2)&nbsp;the               
operator clearly demonstrates that they meet the three-part test.</p>              

<h3><strong>Property Access</strong></h3>   

<p>When dealing with previously unregulated sites that may no longer qualify as            
recycling centers, issues may arise with respect to property access for the EA to            
conduct an investigation. The EA may be denied access by a business claiming to            
be a recycler who doesn’t believe that there is authority to inspect his site            
because it’s not handling solid waste. In fact, the EA does have authority to            
inspect, if it believes that the site may be subject to the EA’s jurisdiction.            
Public Resources Code sections 44100 and 44101 provide broad authority for EA            
inspections to ensure compliance with the Board’s statutes and regulations. The            
Board’s regulations also expressly provide that the EA may inspect a business            
to verify that it is in compliance with the Board’s requirements (three-part          
test).&nbsp; </p><p>As with any solid waste site, it is always preferable to gain            
consent prior to inspecting the property. This will ensure that objections can            
not be raised later about the information obtained in an inspection and that the            
EA will not be accused of trespass. In addition, when dealing with recycling            
sites, the Board’s regulations also provide for the use of a voluntary            
reporting form (CIWMB 607) which can be used by sites to provide an EA with            
enough information to satisfy any concerns about whether the site meets the            
three-part test. EAs should encourage recycling businesses to use this form so            
that any questions that may come up from third parties can more easily be            
handled and explained.</p><p>As with inspections of other solid waste sites, if            
site access is refused (unless there is an emergency affecting the public health            
and safety), the EA will need to seek an inspection warrant. PRC 44101 expressly            
authorizes use of this procedure. What follows is a very general overview of the            
requirements to familiarize you with the type of information that you will need            
to have. However, the exact procedure on how to go about obtaining an inspection            
warrant will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (different legal departments            
will handle these in different ways). You will need to be in close            
communication with your legal counsel to understand what they believe you will            
need to provide them with in order to obtain the warrant.&nbsp; </p><p>An            
inspection warrant is an order signed by a judge allowing the EA to conduct an            
inspection authorized by State law. It is issued upon a showing of cause, based            
upon an affidavit that describes the premises to be inspected and the purpose            
for which the inspection is made. It must also state whether consent to inspect            
was sought and, if not, why the failure to seek consent was justified. Cause is            
deemed to exist if there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity            
exists with respect to the premises. The inspection must be carried out within            
14 days of issuance, between 8 A.M. and 6 P.M. in the presence of the owner or            
occupant, unless otherwise authorized. Failure to permit an inspection            
authorized by the warrant is a misdemeanor offense.&nbsp; </p><p>As with the            
requirements of 14 CCR 17402.5(d), the EA will need to have some information            
that shows why there is reason to believe that the site is not in compliance            
with the three-part test. The exact type and amount of information that will be            
necessary will vary from situation to situation but some general categories of            
information can be described.&nbsp;</p>          

<p> Complaints received are typically the way many of            
these cases might arise. These can be used in an affidavit, but the EA should            
ensure that the complaint is reliable. This means that if the complaint is            
from a business competitor, the EA should ask a few more questions to determine            
the factual basis for the complaint. A complaint of this type, without some other            
factual corroboration, may not be enough to obtain a warrant.&nbsp;</p>          

<p> On the other hand,            
a complaint from an independent party that has used the facility (and thus            
observed conditions) would be more credible. Any factual corroboration would            
also be helpful. For example, the smell of rotting food in surrounding property            
could be a good indication that there is putrescible waste on the site.&nbsp;</p>          

<p> Regular            
sightings of trucks leaving the facility and heading to a disposal site might            
indicate large amounts of residuals. Other factual information could be obtained            
from what is visible to public view (size of piles on site, size of buildings,            
type of equipment in use, etc.). Information could also be obtained by            
investigating the sources of material sent to the site (names on the side of            
trucks hauling material to the facility), and the disposal destination of            
material leaving the site (full trucks being unloaded at the landfill).&nbsp;</p>          

<p> In            
short, any observations that that the EA can make could yield facts that could            
be used in an affidavit. There is no set amount of facts that are needed, but            
the more facts available, the easier obtaining a warrant will be. Prior to            
performing any extensive investigation, you should check with your counsel to            
find out what he or she believes is needed for an affidavit.</p>           

<h2>Enforcement
</h2>

<p>If residuals fluctuate around the 10 percent level, exceeding     
it one month and dropping below it the next, the verification of 10 percent could be a     
significant enforcement burden on LEAs. The Board does not have authority to require records access to the     
incoming materials stream at recycling centers. This being the case, records     
regarding residual waste must be accessed at the back-end of the process. The 10 
percent fluctuation will be addressed on a case-by-case determination, much like     
minimum standards violations or tonnage violations that are present some months     
and not others. If there is a pattern and practice, LEAs could issue a notice     
and order requiring a permit unless action is taken to keep the number     
consistently below 10 percent. Any recycler who doesn’t share information can be     
required to do so. LEAs have authority to inspect records if they believe a     
recycler is operating as a solid waste operation or facility. Public Resources     
Code sections 44100 and 44101 provide LEAs the authority to request records.</p>     

<p>Section 17402(E) allows an LEA or the Board to     
inspect a business to verify that it is conducted in a manner that meets the     
provisions set forth in the definition and to take appropriate enforcement     
action, including the use of a notice and order as provided in sections 18304–18304.3.</p>

<p>A number of other   
provisions in 14 CCR section 17402.5 are relevant and may be useful in drafting   
an enforcement order for a facility:</p>   

<ul>
  <li>A recycling center shall only receive material   
that has been separated for reuse prior to receipt (subsection (d)(1));</li> 
  <li>The only separation that may occur at the   
recycling center is the sorting of materials that have been separated for reuse   
prior to receipt (subsection (d)(3));</li> 
  <li><strong>A   
business that accepts loads of material that are not separated for reuse or   
source separated does not qualify as a recycling center (subsection (d)(6)(A));   
</strong>(emphasis added)</li> 
</ul>

<p>The LEA has the   
authority to require the operator to cease and desist handling municipal solid   
waste until the business obtains a permit. The directive should be in the form   
of an enforcement action which requires the operator to seek the appropriate   
tiered permit if he/she wishes to process accounts that cause the facility to   
exceed the limits of the regulations and accept loads that are contaminated   
with solid waste.</p>   

<h2>Case Studies </h2>

<h3>Case   
Study #1</h3>   

<p>The LEA inspected an activity because of complaints               
received. During the inspection the LEA               
discovered that the business collected commercial loads of material and had               
employees pull out recyclable material. The residual waste was baled and               
transported to a landfill for disposal. The LEA’s initial impression was that the facility was a materials               
recovery facility and required a solid waste facility permit. The operator claimed that they were a               
recycling facility and did not require a solid waste facility permit.  </p>               

<p><strong>Follow-up</strong></p>

<p>The LEA worked on the    
issue with their county counsel and Board staff and the consensus was that the    
facility appeared to be a transfer station engaged in recycling. The facts being: </p>    

<p>1)&nbsp;The              
facility received mixed solid waste as an integral part of their operations.</p>              

<p>2)&nbsp;The              
amount of solid waste handling activities is significant.</p>             

<p>3)&nbsp;Material              
received required additional separation at the facility.</p>              

<p>Subsequently, the LEA    
sent a letter to the operator notifying the operator of their findings and of their    
intent to conduct follow-up inspections. </p>    

<p><strong>Ongoing investigation</strong></p>    

<p>The LEA conducted  
additional inspections, some at night. As a result of the inspections, a report  
of violation was sent to the operator. In the course of their inspections the  
LEA requested records. The operator was not able to provide any records to the  
inspectors on their initial request for them. Based on conversations with the  
operator and visual inspections, the LEA estimated that the facility was  
generating 40 percent residual. A joint inspection was conducted by the LEA and Board  
staff of the subject facility at which time the operator provided records  
showing a residual of 45–50 percent.</p> 

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The LEA issued a    
notice and order to cease transfer station operations and material recovery processing. There  
were several meetings between the LEA, LEA county counsel, operator, and    
operator’s attorney before and after the order was issued to discuss and    
resolve the outstanding issues. The operator ceased solid waste handling    
practices while the LEA confirmed compliance with the order through    
inspections.</p>

<h3>Case   
Study #2</h3>   

<p>A glass recycling facility that receives only glass that           
has been separated at the curb. However, because of the several transfers there           
is a large amount of broken glass. When           
it finally reaches the facility, the material is run through the conveyor belts           
where whole glass is pulled out and the broken glass is sent to the landfill.           
As a result the total amount of residual is over 10 percent. This facility meets the           
first part of the test but fails the second. Therefore, it is within the           
Board’s jurisdiction.</p>           

<p><i>The Board’s view is    
that, although the business appears to be consistent with the first part of the    
test, it fails the second part of the test. Therefore, the business is subject    
to the Board’s regulations.</i></p>    

<h3>Case   
Study #3</h3>   

<p>A recycling facility that receives 700 tons per day of              
curbside green waste, including grass clippings, and 300 tons per day of              
unsaleable produce back-hauled from grocery stores. The operator grinds and mixes both          
waste streams together, then              
hauls the material off site to a composting facility. There is no residual from this activity. Material remains     
on site less than 48 hours.</p>            

<p><i>The business appears to be consistent with the first part of the test—both waste streams are kept separate from the solid waste               
stream. The business also appears to be               
consistent with the second part of the test—the operator hauls 100 percent of the               
material to a composting facility, so none of the material is defined as               
“residual” (i.e, 0 percent residual). The               
LEA, in this case, finds that the facility accepts more than 1 percent     
putrescible wastes so the business fails the third part of the test. Therefore, the               
business is subject to the Board’s regulations.</i></p>               

<h3>Case Study #4</h3>               

<p>Located within the permitted boundary of a transfer/processing facility permitted to received 80 tons per day of mixed solid waste is a construction and demolition (C&amp;D) activity.  The C&amp;D activity is separated by a defined physical barrier and receives 50 tons per day of recyclable C&amp;D material.  The operator contends that since the C&amp;D material is separated for reuse, and a defined physical barrier separates the recycling activity from the solid waste handling activity, he is not required to include the tonnage of the C&amp;D material in the total tons per day of waste for the transfer/processing facility.  The operator obtained a registration permit for a medium volume transfer/processing facility to receive 80 tons per day of mixed solid waste.  The operator recycles 75 percent (25 percent residual) of the C&amp;D material on a monthly average at the C&amp;D activity.</p>               

<p><i>	Title 14, section 14702 states that a recycling center and beverage container recycling programs, where there is a physical barrier separating these programs from the solid waste handling activities, will not be included in the tons per day calculation.  This means that in order for the 50 tons of the C&amp;D material not to count toward the daily tonnage of the transfer/processing facility the activity must be a recycling center.</i></p>               

<p><i>The Board’s view is that, although the C&amp;D activity appears to be consistent with the first part of the test, the residual amount of 25% causes the activity to fail the second part of the test.  Therefore, the C&amp;D activity is not a recycling center and is subject to the Board’s regulations.  The defined physical barrier has no relevance in this case study because the physical barrier, as noted above, would only apply to the separation of a recycling center (section 17402.5(d)).  The handling of the C&amp;D material is subject to section 17400 et seq., unless otherwise specified in separate regulations.  The C&amp;D activity would be considered part of the transfer/processing facility (unless it could also qualify as a separate facility—see LEA Advisory #39 on multiple permit—if so, it would still need a permit since it fails the three-part test).  As a result, the tonnage of the C&amp;D activity counts toward the transfer/processing facility total tonnage: 80 tons per day   + 50 tons per day = 130 tons per day, which is subject to the requirements of a large volume transfer/processing facility.</i></p>               

<h2>Excluded   
Activities</h2>

<p>Activities that are not subject to the transfer/processing regulatory requirements include the following:</p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide
guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties.
Guidance, for this purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board’s
regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a>
