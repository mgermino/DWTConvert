<p><strong>To All Local Enforcement Agencies:</strong></p>  

<p>This advisory provides guidance to local enforcement agencies (LEA)    
on the regulatory and policy changes that the Department of Industrial    
Relations (DIR), Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH)�otherwise    
known as &quot;Cal/OSHA&quot;�has made in order to implement the provisions of  
Assembly Bill (AB) 1127    
for inspections and investigations commencing on or after January 1, 2000.</p>    

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In                          
1997, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) revised the                          
existing Transfer/Processing Operations and Facilities regulations. It was during this revision stage that the                          
existing overlap of regulatory authority of DOSH was eliminated.�In order to clarify the respective                          
authorities relating to Transfer/Processing Operations and Facilities, the                          
CIWMB and DOSH entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU).�All parties        
signatory to the MOU agreed upon                          
primary areas of responsibility and authority, and the process for expediting all                          
interagency disagreements. </p>                          

<p>The                          
MOU defined the working relationship between DOSH, LEAs, and CIWMB.�For example, if the LEA or CIWMB staff                          
believed that there was a threat to worker health and safety that was within                          
the jurisdiction of DOSH, the LEA could refer this condition, activity, or                          
practice to DOSH.� DOSH was then                          
required to act upon all referrals in accordance with Labor Code section 6309. DOSH was required to inform the referring                          
agency in writing regarding any substantive determination made about the                          
referral and about any action taken as a result of the referral.�Lastly, DOSH agreed to participate in CIWMB                          
trainings for LEAs, as appropriate, regarding the recognition of conditions that                          
may be referable to DOSH.</p>                         

<h2>Dissolution of the Transfer/Processing Operations MOU</h2>   

<p>On      
May 21, 2001, the CIWMB�s Executive Director received a letter from John      
Howard, DOSH's Division Chief (<a href="/Safety/OSHAMOU/rescind.pdf">www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Safety/OSHAMOU/rescind.pdf</a>), 
that rescinded the 1999 interagency MOU with the CIWMB regarding worker health and      
safety issues at Transfer/Processing Operations and Facilities. The letter explained that 
AB      
1127, which became effective January 2000, provides LEAs with a      
more-effective means of referring issues concerning worker health and safety      
than the non-statutory provisions of the 1999 MOU. Because of the changes that 
AB 1127 made to the      
California Labor Code, DOSH determined that the MOU was no longer necessary and      
rescinded it. For additional information regarding DOSH, you can visit the DOSH 
Web site at <a href="http://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/">www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/</a>. </p>    

<p>DOSH also expressed an interest in providing information regarding                           
worker health and safety issues, and recommends that LEAs contact the DOSH        
district office in their area. The DOSH Web                           
site provides specific information on their various programs, which include                           
policies, a listing of district offices, and DOSH�s policy and procedures                           
manual (P&amp;P C-7; revised 2/20/02) (<a href="http://www.dir.ca.gov/doshpol/p&amp;pc-7.htm">www.dir.ca.gov/doshpol/p&amp;pc-7.htm</a>), which�describes how DOSH will implement AB 1127. </p>                           

<h2>What is in AB      
1127?</h2>

<p>AB 1127, authored by Assembly member Steinberg, became law on January 1, 2000         
(Chapter 615, Statutes of 1999) and made significant statutory, regulatory, and         
policy changes to the DOSH enforcement process and the California Labor Code (<a href="http://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/ab1127memo.htm">www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/ab1127memo.htm</a>).     
The most significant changes include: </p>         

<ul>
  <li>AB                           
1127 added �representative of a government agency� to the list of persons                           
entitled to file a complaint with DOSH when the agency believes that an                           
employee�s place of work is unsafe (Labor Code �6309).�An LEA is a government agency.�Thus, an LEA may file a complaint with DOSH                           
if it believes that working conditions at a solid waste facility are unsafe.�This enhances the ability of LEAs to promote                           
worker safety beyond that provided under the rescinded MOU, where an LEA could only refer                           
a matter to DOSH.</li>                  
  <li>The                           
new law added that DOSH will conduct investigations when a complaint is                           
received from a government agency, which includes an LEA. The law specifically says that DOSH shall                           
investigate complaints alleging that an employee�s �place of employment is not        
    safe�.as soon as possible, but not later than three working days after receipt                           
of a complaint charging a serious violation, and not later than 14 calendar                           
days after receipt of a complaint charging a non-serious violation" (Labor Code                           
�6309).</li>
  <li>Revision                          
to civil penalties for violation of occupational safety and health standard,                          
order, or special order (Labor Code �6428).</li>                   
  <li>Redefined                          
the definition of a serious violation (Labor Code �6432).</li>                  
  <li>Deletes                          
the longstanding statutory exemption for governmental entities from imposition                          
of DOSH civil penalties (Labor Code �6434).�</li>                   
</ul>

<h2>How does AB1127 provide the LEA with a more effective means of                           
referring worker health and safety issues?�</h2>                           

<p>The                           
most significant regulatory change of AB 1127 adds representatives of                           
government agencies as persons who may file a complaint about workplace                           
safety. Past practice of DOSH was to                           
consider all LEA and CIWMB worker health and safety complaints and concerns a        
�referral.��The revised law expands the                           
definition of a complaint in Labor Code �6309 to give government agencies,        
including an LEA, the right to file formal complaints with DOSH for all solid waste                           
facilities or operations. DOSH is now                           
required to respond to the complaint in a specific number of days�the MOU did                           
not provide that.�The law specifically                           
states that DOSH shall investigate an employee�s unsafe place of employment �as                           
soon as possible, but not later than three working days after receipt of a                           
complaint charging a serious violation, and not later than fourteen calendar                           
days after receipt of a complaint charging a non-serious violation.&quot;�The revisions to Labor Code �6309 <strong>provide        
LEAs with a more-effective means of forwarding worker health and safety 
concerns to DOSH for compliance purposes</strong>.</p> 

<p>Under         
AB 1127, an LEA can file a complaint on         
worker health and safety issues on all<strong> solid waste facilities, </strong>not just         
transfer/processing operations and facilities as was provided by the 1999 MOU. </p> 

<p>The                           
amended Labor Code Section �6309 also requires that DOSH �shall keep                           
complete and accurate records of any complaints, whether verbal or written, and                           
shall inform the complainant, whenever his or her identity is known, of any                           
action taken by DOSH in regard to the subject matter of the complaint, and the                           
reasons for the action.��In other                           
words, DOSH is not only required to contact the referring agency complainant                           
but is also required to maintain detailed records.</p>                           

<p>Complainants         
who identify themselves to DOSH are notified of the results of an         
investigation. If DOSH determines that         
no violation exists, written notification of this determination is given to the 
complainant who then has the right to request a review by DOSH.</p>        

<h2>What is the difference between the DOSH Enforcement Program and the DOSH        
Consultation Services Program?</h2>        

<p>The Department of Industrial                           
Relations� DOSH program is responsible for protecting workers and the public from                           
safety hazards by enforcing California's occupational and public safety laws.                           
The DOSH program is responsible for enforcing California laws and regulations                           
pertaining to workplace safety and health and for providing assistance to                           
employers and workers about workplace safety and health issues. DOSH covers virtually all workers in the                           
state, including those employed by State and local government.�DOSH does not cover federal employees,                           
offshore maritime workers, or domestic service workers in private households.�The worker health and safety standards are                           
contained in the California Code of Regulations, Title 8,� Industrial Relations.�Two major programs within DOSH carrying out                           
these responsibilities are the Compliance Program and the Consultation                           
Program.��A Guide To DOSH� provides                           
more detailed information on these two program or can be accessed at the                           
following Web address: <a href="http://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/osha_userguide.pdf">www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/osha_userguide.pdf</a>.&nbsp;For additional information regarding

<h3>DOSH Enforcement Unit</h3>          

<p>DOSH is authorized to conduct            
inspections of California workplaces based on worker complaints, accident            
reports, scheduled compliance inspections, and identified high hazard            
industries. Every workplace covered by DOSH may be subject to inspection by            
compliance safety and health staff considered as part of the 22 DOSH            
Enforcement Unit district offices statewide to enforce worker health and safety            
regulations. Also housed in these            
district offices are specialized enforcement units that address workplace            
hazards in high hazard industries, such as the Mining and Tunneling Unit and            
the High Hazard Enforcement Unit. Other specialized units include the Crane            
Certifier Accreditation Unit, the Asbestos Contactors� Registration Unit, and            
the Asbestos Consultant and Site Surveillance Technician Unit. </p>            

<p>A DOSH inspection of the            
workplace can be either �programmed planned� (randomly selected in a specific            
industry or as part of a special emphasis program) or �unprogrammed� (based on            
an accident resulting in a fatality, catastrophe, serious injury/exposure or            
resulting from a complaint). </p>            

<p>Inspections resulting from a                          
complaint of a hazard or violation believed to exist in a workplace are                          
classified by DOSH as formal or informal and have deadline investigation                          
response times. A formal complaint                          
filed by an employee, employee representative, employer of an employee at a                          
multi-employer worksite, or a representative of a government agency results in                          
an on-site investigation within three working days for serious complaints and                          
within fourteen days for non-serious complaints. An informal complaint filed by anyone who is not an employee or                          
employer, or an anonymous complaint is investigated by phone/fax and deemed                          
non-serious by letter to the employer.� </p>                          

<p>DOSH inspectors have very                           
specific requirements on how the inspection must be conducted.� For more information,

<h3>DOSH Consultation Services</h3>           

<p>To encourage voluntary                          
compliance with occupational safety and health regulations and to help reduce                          
workplace injury and illness rates, the DOSH Consultation Service offers free                          
assistance to employers and employees.� Consultation services include:�on-site visits and compliance assistance, injury and illness prevention                          
program improvements, and publications and educational outreach. </p>                          

<p>Employers may request on-site                          
assistance, which DOSH will provide only through employer invitation. Employees and employee groups may request                          
consultation away from the job site.�The Consultation Service is separate and distinct from enforcement                          
operations of DOSH, and consultants do not participate in enforcement                          
activities.�All communications between                          
the employer and the Consultation Service are held in confidence and not shared                          
with DOSH enforcement staff. </p>                          

<p>On-site consultation visits do                          
not result in citations or penalties.�However, in return for receiving free on-site assistance, the employer                          
must agree to timely correction of hazards identified.</p>

<h2>Additional CIWMB Support for LEAs</h2>            

<p>DOSH inspects solid waste                          
facilities statewide based on their scheduling ability, as needed, or in                          
response to complaints received but usually not at the frequency that LEAs                          
inspect.�By filing complaints when                          
needed, AB 1127 provides LEAs with the ability to work with facility operators                          
to ensure that potential accidents, injuries, and illnesses are prevented at                          
these facilities.�To provide LEAs with                          
additional assistance on DOSH issues, the CIWMB's LEA Support Services Branch has                          
identified the need for future educational and training venues and guidance                          
documents on the DOSH complaint process. </p>                          

<p>The                           
Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health                           
has authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards to protect                           
workers in California. As government                           
representatives, it is our responsibility to support those activities that                           
protect workers.�AB1127 provides a �<strong>representative

complaint of any unsafe or unhealthy condition that could lead to an employee                           
becoming injured or ill.�AB 1127                           
requires that the complainant be notified of that investigation�s outcome.�We encourage LEAs to establish a working                           
relationship with local DOSH or DOSH district offices and maintaining ongoing                           
communication with DOSH personnel will allow for better protection of workers                           
at these facilities.�While it is                           
certainly the prerogative of LEAs to work with their operation, facility, and                           
site operators, we encourage the reporting of occupational health and safety                           
problems detected during monthly inspections. </p>                          

<p>I have asked the LEA Support Services Branch to continue to work                          
with LEAs in providing assistance on inspection-related worker health and                          
safety issues.�CIWMB staff will                          
continue to solicit your needs and develop tools and methods to assist LEAs.�Further questions concerning this LEA        
advisory or                          
any issues relating to inspection-related worker health and safety issues may                          
be directed to
<a href="/StaffDirectory/Employee/455/">Diane Kihara</a> or <a href="/StaffDirectory/Employee/333/"> Marc Arico</a>.</p>

<p class="FinePrint">The intent of the advisories is to provide 
guidance to Local Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in performing their duties. 
Guidance, for this purpose, is defined as providing explanation of the Board�s 
regulations and statutes.</p>
<p class="FinePrint">Unless included by reference in the LEA's Enforcement 
Program Plan (EPP), advisories are not enforceable in the same manner as 
regulations because they have not been adopted through the formal rulemaking 
process (see Government Code sections <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11340-11342.4">11340.5</a> 
and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=11001-12000&amp;file=11342.510-11342.610">11342.6</a>). 
Advisories do not take precedence over statute or regulation.</p><a href="../"><strong>Advisories Home</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>|
