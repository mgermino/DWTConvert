<h2 class="ListIntro"><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.burbank.k12.ca.us">
The Burbank Unified School District</a> (USD) is located in northern Los Angeles 
County and serves the City of Burbank. John Muir Middle School and John 
Burroughs High School actively participated in the Environmental Ambassador Pilot 
Program (EAPP). Burbank USD was selected as an Environmental Ambassador because 
of its strong track record in recycling. Much of the district�s strength lies in 
its partnership with Burbank�s Public Works Department and the city-operated 
Burbank Recycle Center. The city provides free recycling collection at all 
school sites. The city works with the district to encourage innovative waste 
diversion programs at the school sites and provides outreach and education to 
students.</p>
<p>On environmental education matters, the district also partners with local 
organizations, including the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.creec.org/region11/">California Regional Environmental Education 
Community Network (CREEC-LA)</a>, 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.treepeople.org/">TreePeople</a>, the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.generationearth.com/">County�s Generation Earth program</a>, 
the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/PublicWorks/eng-envir-wrs/water_rec_plant.htm">Burbank Water Reclamation Plant</a>, and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/main/homepage/homepage.html">Warner Bros. Studios</a>. The district 
planned to use its existing connections with local resource providers and State 
agencies to fully develop its status as a model Environmental Ambassador.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">Burbank USD�s education-related achievements during the 
EAPP grant period included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Having Burbank USD�s education programs in the EAPP complement and 
	leverage Learn and Serve grant funding provided by the California Department 
	of Education for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/sl/">CalServe</a>, a multi-year, service-learning development 
	program that supports the district�s requirement for students to complete a 
	service-learning project during middle/high school as a condition of 
	graduation.</li>
	<li>Developing curricular units and lessons across most subject areas for 
	grades 6�12, with a focus on resource conservation as well as campus 
	recycling and composting activities.</li>
	<li>Combining Cesar Chavez grant funding with the EAPP funds and support 
	from <a target="_blank" href="http://wbsf.warnerbros.com/">Warner Bros. Studios</a> and the 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/publicworks/Recycle-Center/">Burbank Recycle Center</a> to develop 
	garden-centered learning that includes composting, classroom vermicomposting, 
	and Bokashi (compost by fermentation) in the teacher�s lounge and some 
	classrooms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ListIntro"><a name="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and Obstacles</h2>
<p>All teachers, administrators and community partners agreed that the common 
planning time afforded by the teacher stipends by the grant program was very 
valuable, both in planning educational support and diversion, garden activities.</p>
<p>All agreed that sustaining common planning time without grant funds would be 
unrealistic, thereby challenging continued collaboration. Most or all teachers 
did not have planning time outside their departments to promote collaboration 
across subject areas.</p>
<p>One other obstacle is that most participating teachers did not have students 
in common. Additionally, the added workload discouraged many teachers from 
joining the team.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">The Burbank USD team proved that student-driven programs to 
recycle on campus can be effective, if organized properly. This requires:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Convenience-�a recycling container next to every trash can, with many 
	locations around campus;</li>
	<li>Motivation-�students collecting the recycling are members of clubs which 
	benefit from the proceeds;</li>
	<li>Campus "culture" that promotes pride in conservation; and</li>
	<li>Infrastructure to provide pickup and delivery of materials collected to 
	a recycling center. </li>
</ol>
<p>The City of Burbank Recycle Center is attempting to overcome the annual 
back-to-school learning curve for school recycling. They produce a newsletter 
for the schools called "School Recycling News." </p>
<p>In fall 2006, the Recycle Center held two after-school workshops as a 
recycling "refresher course" for teachers and administrators. Food and 
information was provided.</p>
<p>The Burbank USD has also established a Service Learning Committee, in an 
effort to establish better ties to the community where projects would be 
conducted, as well as resolve program issues and formulate policies for district 
consideration. The committee is a large group which meets several times each 
school year.</p>

<h2 class="ListIntro"><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Burbank USD�s diversion-related achievements during the 
EAPP grant period included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adopting a <a href="Resolution.pdf">resolution on sustainability and resource efficiency</a> 
	(Adobe PDF, 205 KB) in the 
	design and construction of district projects. This resolution stipulated the 
	district would incorporate criteria established by the Collaborative for 
	High Performance Schools (CHPS) in construction projects when feasible.</li>
	<li>Continuing collaborative work with the city-operated Burbank Recycle 
	Center to accommodate the district�s increased recycling needs. The city 
	provides free recycling collection to the district.</li>
	<li>Implementing a paper recycling program in all classrooms, thereby 
	greatly increasing the amount of paper recycling. Most campus recycling 
	programs are student-run, resulting in minimal impact on custodial staff.</li>
	<li>Increasing recycling of cans, bottles, paper, batteries, and ink 
	cartridges within the district, and the number of on-site school gardens.</li>
	<li>Burbank USD purchased a mulching lawn mower with grant funds. This 
	equipment has been documented to save time and create efficiencies for the 
	maintenance staff.</li>
	<li>A beverage container recycling program at the John Muir Middle School 
	and the John Burroughs High School that resulted in a revenue increase of at 
	least $2,500 per year at each school.</li>
	<li>Recycling electronic waste material.</li>
	<li>Implementation of several changes in resource management practices that 
	may not have resulted in quantifiable waste reduction, but are nevertheless 
	just as important for resource conservation, such as purchase and use of 
	steam-based equipment for pest management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ListIntro"><a name="Lessons">Lessons</a> Created</h2>
<p>Lessons created by the teams tied to the EAPP program as well as to the 
CalServe Learn and Serve program. This blending provided a way for teachers to 
create standards-based lessons for their subject areas which addressed waste 
management and conservation, while giving the students opportunity to engage in 
service learning. The lessons included here include elective courses offered by 
the two schools, in addition to core subject areas. </p>
<p>A notable lesson was the eighth grade science lesson, where students investigated the 
properties of household batteries and the potential health hazards from improper 
disposal. These students were so motivated by the lessons that they implemented 
a campus-wide household battery collection program. The effort included posters, 
a brochure, and organized collection efforts.</p>
