<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://cms.dsusd.k12.ca.us">Desert Sands Unified School District</a> (USD) is located in the Coachella 
Valley in eastern Riverside County, and it lies within the boundaries of six 
jurisdictions: Bermuda Dunes, Rancho Mirage, Indio, La Quinta, Palm Desert, and 
Indian Wells. Four elementary schools, one middle school, and and one high 
school from the district participated in the Environmental Ambassador Pilot 
Program (EAPP).</p>
<p>Desert Sands USD was selected to be an Environmental Ambassador because of 
its strong track record in recycling. The district�s environmental services 
manager position has allowed for planned resource conservation programs to be 
established and maintained at the district level. The environmental services 
manager works with all of the district�s school sites to encourage the 
establishment of recycling programs tailored for each school�s needs and 
provides resource conservation education for the district�s teachers. The 
district also has strong external support provided by the Desert Resources 
Council, made up of 25 local conservation organizations.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">Desert Sands USD�s education programs under the EAPP 
project became an integral component of a much larger Voluntary Public School 
Choice (VPSC) federal grant to the district. Some of the highlights of the 
education programs included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Developing a unified vision of resource conservation 
	centered on the local desert environment for curricula, resulting in 
	institutionalization of the programs at the six VPSC schools.</li>
	<li>
	Team planning across grade levels and subject areas, 
thereby allowing the teachers to create instructional units that build 
sequentially from kindergarten through twelfth grade.</li>
	<li>
	Developing environmental themes that unify each school 
	site and grade-specific standards-based lessons that reflect these themes.</li>
	<li>
	Disseminating the instructional units to additional 
	teachers each year as the program progressed.</li>
	<li>
	Fostering long-term community partnerships to provide 
	sustainability of the field activities and student involvement.</li>
	<li>
	Linking lessons to the waste diversion and conservation 
practices on the campuses where possible.</li>
	<li>
	City and local partners sponsored an Environmental Art 
Contest for the District.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ListIntro">The EAPP grant enabled Desert Sands USD to meet its 
commitment under the Voluntary Public School Choice federal grant to develop a 
family of magnet schools (K�12) with a technology and environment focus.</p>
<h2><a name="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and Obstacles</h2>
<p>The District provided a thorough evaluation of the program in its final 
report for the EAPP. This evaluation will be available to view on this website 
soon.</p>
<p>Another exciting insight into efforts at this Desert Sands USD is 
documentation regarding the gardens created in the program. This documentation 
will be available to view on this web site soon.</p>

<h2><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Desert Sands USD�s diversion-related achievements during 
the EAPP grant period included: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Adopting a formal district wide integrated waste management policy.</li>
	<li>Implementing a pilot food waste composting program in collaboration with 
	local jurisdictions, the hauler, and a local compost facility.</li>
	<li>Developing a cooperative recycled-content product purchasing 
	consortium in collaboration with local jurisdictions.</li>
	<li>Establishing a collaborative working relationship with the hauler to 
	meet increased diversion needs.</li>
	<li>Establishing a school recycling competition and recognition program.</li>
	<li>Developing a district wide program for classroom paper recycling.</li>
	<li>Expanding the types of material diverted from the Food Service 
	Department.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Lessons">Lessons</a> Created</h2>
<p>The family of six schools in the VPSC/EAPP team developed an overarching K-12 
learning theme: <i>How do the natural and social systems of the Coachella Valley 
interact?</i> This formed the basis for each school team to develop a theme, and 
then grade-level- appropriate standards-based lessons were developed. So for 
instance, the focus of a 5th grade lesson at Carter Elementary focus was "to 
view the plants within their natural environment (the dune) and observe the 
changes and adaptations of the plants as man intrudes." The students studied a 
portion of the Coachella Valley natural/social systems on and near their campus at Carter Elementary: the sand 
dunes.</p>
<p>The Palm Desert High School Staff and Curriculum Development program 
initially included five teachers who created an interdisciplinary unit across 
these subject areas: English grade 9, biology,
English language development, chemistry, mathematics, and 
social studies. The overall focus of the unit is "Saline Lakes: Local and Global 
Perspectives." The service-learning experience for students was a trip to the 
environs of the Salton Sea, and wetlands development and salt cedar removal. 
Data for the students' research project was shared from monitoring of New River 
wetlands, New River waters, and 29 Palms tribal U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (U.S. EPA) work. The team had focus 
group meetings, consisting of after-school, one-hour informational sessions. 
Each session addressed one of the following topics: WebAssign, Flexcamera (two cameras were purchased with other 
funding as a result of the sessions), digital camera/digital photo, Classroom 
Performance Systems demonstration,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.turnitin.com">Turnitin.com</a> (online 
services for educators), dimensional analysis, and 
digital curriculum.</p>
<p>Lessons from all six schools, grade levels K-12, will be accessible on this 
website soon.</p>

<h2><a name="StudentWork">Student</a> Work Samples and Accomplishments</h2>
<p>The project "The Wonderful, Weird World of Worms" was honored with seven 
awards at the International Student Media Festival in October 2005. The entire 
multimedia project won an Excellence in Media Award along with a Best of 
Festival Award. "Take the Time," a public service announcement on recycling, won 
an Excellence in Media Award and also a Best of Festival Award. "Recycle Lunch," a 
training video on how to recycle leftover lunch items at school, won an 
Excellence in Media Award. The multimedia project and the public service 
announcement also won Judges Choice Awards. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the multimedia
project won first place for instructional multimedia in the California Student Media and 
Multimedia Festival. The project was led by Judy Grenier, a 2nd grade teacher, 
along with the Technology Specialist, Linda Reynolds, at Lincoln Elementary. If 
you would like more information, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ismf.net/">International Student Media</a>.</p>
<p>Desert Sands USD and the projects at Palm Desert High School won a 2005 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov/Awards/GEELA">Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award</a>.</p>
<p>La Quinta High School was not a part of the VPSC/EAPP program, but it was 
included in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/general/educate/svclearn.pdf">booklet containing 17 profiles</a> from across the U.S. of K-12 
school-based and community projects focusing on safe solid waste 
management. The high school's inclusion in the booklet, published by U.S. EPA, is a sign 
of the district's conservation "culture."</p>
