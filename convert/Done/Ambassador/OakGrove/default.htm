<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ogusd.org">Oak Grove Union School District</a> is a two-school district located in Sonoma 
County. Both schools actively participated in the Environmental Ambassador Pilot 
Program. The district was selected as an Environmental Ambassador because of its 
long-term efforts in recycling, composting, gardening, and energy and water 
conservation, all areas in which the students are actively involved. The 
district also serves as a demonstration site for numerous schools regarding the 
mechanical aspects of recycling and diversion.</p>
<p>The district�s superintendent, 
elementary school principal, and teachers expressed strong interest in more 
effectively integrating all aspects of the Environmental Ambassador Pilot 
Program into their classroom instructional practices. The middle school 
principal and teachers quickly added strength to the team with their commitment 
to serve as Ambassadors and have continued to excel in their efforts by 
establishing a partnership with both the sixth graders at Oak Grove Union School 
District and students in Japan pursuing the same types of studies. Community 
groups, parents, and some local agencies are currently providing support to the 
program.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">Education programs implemented with grant funds included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creating standards-based unit plans for use in pilot schools.</li>
	<li>Developing and implementing service-learning projects regarding storm 
	water management and water conservation on school campuses.</li>
	<li>Developing student-initiated service-learning projects that focus on 
	waste diversion, energy conservation, restoration and protection of a local 
	creek, and used oil management.</li>
	<li>Participating in an information exchange/correspondence program with 
	elementary students in Japan that center on storm water management, water 
	conservation, and creek restoration.</li>
</ul>
<p>School representatives have expressed a strong interest in mentoring others 
regarding the integrated education program once it is fully developed and 
functioning well in their schools. Both schools are part of a district with a 
commitment to resource conservation, evidenced by their solar panel-supported 
portable classrooms, xeriscaped entranceways, and involvement in zero water 
runoff projects.</p>
<h2 class="ListIntro"><strong><a name="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and Obstacles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Realizing the need to collect recycled-content product information for 
	grant tracking purposes, Oak Grove�s district secretary created an
	<a href="OrderForm.htm">electronic purchase order form</a> that features a 
	column for the percentage of recycled-content in items being ordered. This 
	purchase order form will continue to be used by the district in hopes of 
	encouraging district staff to look for recycled-content product options.</li>
	<li>Students from the fifth and sixth grades, accompanied by their teachers, 
	presented information on stormwater management and creek restoration 
	projects at the 2005 National Service Learning Conference in Long Beach. 
	Afterward, the students and their teachers traveled to Japan to make a 
	similar presentation at a conference there, facilitated through a 
	partnership with their "sister school" in Hamamatsu, Yoshin Elementary.</li>

learning); and creating vegetable gardens at schools for use in their lunch 
programs (also serves as a foundation for K�2 curriculum units).</li>
	<li>Switching to single-stream recycling at both schools.</li>
	<li>Developing a video of diversion-related activities and projects.</li>
</ul>
