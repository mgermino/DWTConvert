<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p>Located in northeast Sacramento County, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sanjuan.edu/">San 
Juan Unified School District</a> (SJUSD) comprises more than 80 schools. Two 
elementary schools, one middle school, and three high schools participated in 
the grant program. The district was selected for the Environmental Ambassador 
Pilot Program because of its demonstrated commitment to developing a "green 
schools" program and its interest in expanding successes in this area to other 
resource conservation and waste diversion issues.</p>
<p>The district�s planning 
department and curriculum and instruction unit worked together to support 
school-based resource conservation efforts and identify connections to 
instruction practices, such as use of the EIC Model�. The district also had an 
energy and resource conservation plan team consisting of principals, teachers, 
custodians, and facility and district staff. There also appeared to be good 
support by the district for helping teachers develop new standards-based 
instructional programs related to resource conservation and waste diversion.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">Education programs planned for this grant included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Developing lessons for participating elementary, middle school, and high 
school students based on content and skills outlined in California�s academic 
content standards by using environmental concepts and conservation topics.</li>
	<li>Incorporating mathematics lessons as kindergarten students recycled bottles 
and cans. The funds raised from the recycling efforts were kept and used to open 
savings accounts at a local bank for each participating kindergarten student.</li>
	<li>Incorporating English-language arts lessons as kindergarten students 
analyzed landfill construction practices and made predictions about their own 
on-site mock landfills.</li>
	<li>Incorporating English-language arts lessons as high school students wrote 
persuasive essays about an individual�s impact on and responsibility to the 
environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The individual EAPP teams used waste audits as the springboard for developing 
standards-based units. Students were then allowed to select a service-learning 
project with the focus on cleanup or conservation outreach. Student-driven 
clean-up efforts centered on Sacramento�s local "Creek Week" and showcasing 
student artwork to promote a litter-free and recycling-conscious campus. 
Elementary student teams conducted classroom energy audits and, in turn, 
provided each classroom with an "Energy Catch Slip" that indicated the 
classroom�s energy conservation and usage.</p>
<h2><a name="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and Obstacles</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Developing a sustainable recycling program has been a major 
focus of the EAPP team. Since the team chose to pilot waste reduction programs 
at five schools (a sixth joined later), the district now faces the challenge of creating a 
sustainable program district-wide. Following are several 
actual or desired results that will help this program to succeed 
long-term:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The schools <i>have</i> successfully demonstrated their ability to 
	involve and motivate students and staff to recycle effectively. Students and 
	staff want to recycle  
	and are pressing for 
	recycling opportunities, and their desire is reflected in the success of 
	this pilot program.</li>
	<li>This program demonstrated that recycling will thrive when the necessary 
	infrastructure is provided. That infrastructure includes in-classroom bins, 
	a cart to transport the recyclables, and an external recycling dumpster for 
	placement of materials. Each campus had the flexibility to tailor its 
	recycling program to the unique physical and operational characteristics of 
	the campus. That was all achieved while maintaining a consistent recycling 
	approach that was applied at elementary, middle, and high school campuses.</li>
	<li>The district should be able to realize a cost savings due to reduced 
	garbage service levels.</li>
	<li>The district has not yet addressed the need for a consistent 
	district-wide contract with a waste hauler or recycler for consistent 
	recycling service. Consistent recycling service is needed to promote a 
	sustainable program.</li>
	<li>Maintenance and Operations and custodial staff
	support the recycling efforts with staff time and resources but are stretched 
	very thin, and these recycling efforts can be perceived as additional tasks. 
	With a team of students removing paper or other recyclables from all the 
	classrooms in each school weekly, custodial responsibilities could be 
	reduced and the efforts would be mutually beneficial.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ListIntro">To continue the successes and sustain the waste diversion 
programs currently underway, the district should consider
taking the following actions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Secure a contract with a waste hauler or recycler to provide a 
	consistent district-wide recycling program to all district facilities. This 
	could entail negotiating a new waste hauling contract with a waste service 
	provider that includes consistent recycling service and economic incentives 
	that encourage decreased waste disposal. Another option is to consider 
	separate district-wide recycling and waste hauling contracts. Once 
	consistent opportunities are established at each school, individual campuses 
	can tailor the program to meet their own needs. For example: In some cases 
	student classes or environmental groups can operate a recycling program, and 
	in other cases the custodian should be responsible. A program that is simple 
	and easy to participate in is important to ensure success.</li>
	<li>Adopt a district-wide 
	waste reduction policy which includes purchasing recycled-content products.</li>
	<li>Adopt standard operating 
	procedures for the waste reduction programs, including ongoing education and 
	training for staff.</li>
	<li>Establish a team (as part of job duties) to be responsible for 
	overseeing the waste and recycling needs of the district. Potential members 
	should include, but are not limited to, a contract manager, an accountant, a 
	maintenance and operations lead, and a recycling lead. Some tasks for 
	consideration by this team would be expanding the recycling program; 
	monitoring of service levels to maximize the cost of service (for example, 
	does a school still need waste service five days a week if that school is 
	recycling?); and identifying ways to reduce contamination and litter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Establishing support from the highest 
district level is critical to integrating recycling into policy and standard 
operating procedures.</p>
<h2><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<p>The district is commended for its efforts to increase waste diversion during 
the timeframe of the EAPP Program. During the grant period, the SJUSD 
successfully implemented waste reduction programs at five schools. These 
included: Cameron Ranch Elementary, Cottage Elementary, Mira Loma High School, 
and Mesa Verde High School. Jonas Salk Middle&nbsp; School joined at the end of the grant 
period.</p>
<p>Prior to implementation of the pilot program, most schools in the district 
did not have any recycling service. Some very notable exceptions were recycling 
efforts at Mesa Verde and Mira Loma High Schools where very devoted teachers 
established recycling programs that have been highly successful for many years. 
Although these well established efforts have been highly successful, it is 
recommended that consistent district-wide implementation of a recycling program 
will be more sustainable.</p>
<p>Recycling should be part of the district's operating procedures and should 
not require isolated and extra focus by a few highly dedicated individuals. 
Additionally, consistent implementation of a recycling program across all grade 
levels will help to establish recycling as a standard practice for students as 
they transition to different schools.</p>
<p>The district�s disposal service is provided regularly for the 10 months of 
the traditional school year and is then reduced to an as-needed or on-call basis 
for the two summer months and Christmas break. Based on 2000/2001 figures, the 
annual cost of garbage service was approximately $230,000 per year. Notably, 
this bill is paid at the district level so disposal costs are transparent to the 
individual schools and facilities.</p>
<p>The district worked with its current waste service provider to add recycling 
service to the pilot schools in the 
program. This was a commingled recycling program that 
accepted all fiber materials (cardboard, white paper, newspaper, magazines, 
mixed paper, etc.), beverage containers, tin cans, and other recyclables. It is 
important to note that standard service with this provider did not include 
recycling service.</p>
<p>Schools had an option of receiving a 3- or 4-cubic-yard 
recycling bin at an additional service cost. The pilot schools' recycling bins were generally serviced one 
time per week. The district should realize cost savings by reducing waste 
service levels (i.e., from service five times per week to three times 
per week) and increasing recycling levels. One individual from each school site 
or facility should be responsible for monitoring waste and recycling service 
levels to ensure maximum efficiency of the program. </p>
<p>Additionally, the district currently participates in oil and battery 
recycling (in the Transportation Department), toner cartridge recycling (in the 
Printing Department), and grasscycling (done by the department responsible for 
turf management). Small quantities of beverage containers are also collected and 
recycled unofficially by custodial staff, school clubs, and even neighbors of 
the school. By the spring of 2005, changes in the district�s waste diversion 
program included bulk ordering of paper copies for the elementary schools to 
help minimize cost and reduce waste.</p>
<p>This report is probably missing a number of diversion activities occurring in 
this district due largely to the fact that the district is so large. With over 
80 schools and numerous other facilities, it is highly recommended that the 
district utilize its influence 
to negotiate a contract with a waste hauler or recycler that promotes resource 
conservation. A district policy clearly defining recycling and waste reduction 
as a directive should help this SJUSD to establish a sustainable program for 
many years to come.</p>
