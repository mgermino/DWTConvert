<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.sdcoe.k12.ca.us/districts/warner/">Warner Unified School District</a> is a two-school, K�12 school district located in 
rural eastern San Diego County. Both schools in this district participated in 
the Environmental Ambassador Pilot Program. Warner USD was selected to 
participate as an Environmental Ambassador due to its strong demonstration of 
conservation practices for the past eight years, despite its remote location and 
lack of access to recycling markets.</p>
<p>As an example of Warner USD�s commitment to 
resource conservation, the Warner School and Community Conservation Program that 
services the surrounding rural community recycled more than 10,000 gallons of 
used motor oil and 50,000 pounds of reusable materials by 2004. This activity is 
operated by the students and teachers at Warner USD and receives continuous 
funding through CIWMB�s used oil block grants in cooperation with the County of 
San Diego.</p>
<p>In addition, Warner USD developed a native plant garden and built a 
greenhouse in an effort to grow oak seedlings from acorns for the purpose of 
restoring oak woodlands burned in recent fires. The greenhouse and the native 
plant garden are used as centers of education for both students and community 
members.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">Educational efforts focused on the development of standards-based K�12 units 
related to local conservation and actual waste diversion activities on campus, 
including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A focus on English-language arts and science standards in grades K�3, using 
classroom vermicomposting and classroom paper recycling as the vehicle for 
student investigation.</li>
	<li>A focus on life cycles, earth science, and physical science centered on the 
oak tree project and the native plant garden in grades 4 and 5.</li>
	<li>A focus on energy conservation and used oil recycling in grades 6�8.</li>
	<li>A focus on soil science, chemistry, biology, and waste management alternatives 
using compost from the campus vermicomposting system at the district�s "swine 
unit" (where swine manure is recycled for energy generation) as the center of 
the studies in grades 9�12.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of the curricular planning and the accessibility of the actual waste 
diversion practices at Warner USD, most, if not all, students were involved at 
some point during the school year in a service-learning project. </p>

<h2><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Warner USD�s diversion-related activities during the EAPP grant period included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adopting a districtwide resolution on environmental policies and actions tied 
to waste reduction and educational standards.</li>
	<li>Collaborating with the County of San Diego to purchase a chipper to facilitate 
on-site composting of the schools� green waste and paper waste and a baler for 
cardboard to facilitate cardboard recycling.</li>
	<li>Establishing an outdoor windrow-style vermicomposting system at Warner High 
School, through the Agricultural Department, using swine manure, chipped green 
waste and classroom paper waste, and occasionally food waste from the cafeteria. 
The final compost product is used on the campus vineyard.</li>
	<li>Recycling large food cans from the kitchens.</li>
	<li>The district also serves the surrounding community by operating the CRV 
(California redemption value) container recycling and used oil recycling through 
the Warner School and Community Conservation Program.</li>
</ul>
