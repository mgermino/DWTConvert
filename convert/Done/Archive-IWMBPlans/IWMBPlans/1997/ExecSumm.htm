<h2>Purpose of the Integrated Waste Management Board's <i>Strategic Plan</h2>
</i></strong>

<p>Beginning in 1989 with the enactment of the Integrated Waste Management Act, the waste
management hierarchy of &quot;source reduction; recycling and composting; and
environmentally safe transformation and environmentally safe land disposal&quot; served as
the primary prioritization tool for the Integrated Waste Management Board. Yet, since
1989, numerous amendments to the act have added to the Board's responsibilities, while
maintaining the same revenue structure based on the solid waste tipping fee.</p>

<p>Now, as the Board is poised to usher in achievement of the 50 percent waste diversion
mandate in the year 2000, it is faced with the challenge of continuing to support the
waste management hierarchy while also maintaining its regulatory oversight role. 1997 is a
critical year in redefining the Board's priorities between now and the year 2000, in order
to ensure the success of key waste reduction and environmental protection mandates. The
Board's direction regarding priorities will continue to provide a framework for responding
to declining resources.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the Board's methodology allowed for development of the plan's key
elements by a diverse group of representatives of the organization, beginning with the
Board members and the Executive Director, and continuing through the Executive Staff team,
and Board member advisors, as well as the first and second line members of the broader
management team. In addition, the various elements of the plan have been formally approved
by the Board via its formal hearing process, thereby also allowing for broader public
participation in the final adoption of the plan. As the Board moves forward to create
action plans that prioritize the tasks of staff, Board staff will be involved in the
development of these plans. In this way, the Board is striving to create a strategic plan
that incorporates all of the thinking of the various levels of the organization, both
vertically and horizontally, in order to achieve a plan that is understood and embraced
throughout the organization.</p>
<strong>

<h2>Scope of the Plan</h2>
</strong>

<p>The Board's <i>1997 Strategic Plan</i> contains the following elements: vision,
mission, and value statements; a description of Board programs and the internal/external
assessment process; four strategic goals; objectives, strategies and performance measures
supporting the four goals; an implementation and monitoring plan; resource assumptions;
and financial information.</p>

<p>These elements describe a framework for the Board's vital work between now and the year
2001. The plan supports the Board's unique purpose to advocate a shift in thinking and
practice that garbage is not a waste but a resource, with the potential to strengthen the
state's economy while minimizing threats to public health and safety and the environment.
This unique purpose is the focus of the Board's mission statement. As the Board looks to
the year 2001, its vision reflects the future outcome of its mission: that solid waste is
the sum total of valuable materials with the ability to enhance the economic and
environmental climate of the people of California. The ability to provide state-of-the-art
technical assistance, training, and information regarding materials management will define
the achievement of the Board's vision to become national and international leaders in this
arena. Together, the Board's mission and vision statements support the California
Environmental Protection Agency's strategic direction to ensure a healthy environment and
economy by providing leadership to the state, the nation and the world.</p>

<h2>Key Elements of the Strategic Plan</h2>

<p>The following are the key elements of the Board's <i>1997 Strategic Plan</i>:</p>

<h3>Mission:</h3>
<i>

<p>&quot;Our mission is to reduce the generation and improve the management of solid waste
in California to conserve resources, develop sustainable recycling markets, and protect
public health and safety, and the environment. We do this in partnership with public
agencies, industry, business, and the public we serve.&quot;</p>
</i>

<h3>Vision:</h3>

<i>

<p>&quot;Our vision is that the Integrated Waste Management Board will be the recognized
national and international leader in the integrated management of waste and recovered
materials to best serve the public, the economy, and the environment of California.&quot;</p>
</i>

<h3>Goals: 

</h3><ul>
<li>To support the Integrated Waste Management Act
    of 1989 (as amended) and the waste management hierarchy, mandates, and objectives the law
    created. </li>
<li>To support local jurisdictions' ability to reach
    and maintain California's waste diversion mandates. </li>
<li>To ensure compliance with California and
    federal waste management statutes and regulations while maximizing protection of the
    public health and safety, and the environment. </li>
<li>To ensure that the needs of constituents
    and staff are met through the integrated delivery of quality products and services. The
    Board does this by constantly evaluating its own programs for effectiveness and
    responsiveness.</li></ul>


<h2>Relationship of the Plan to the Budget</h2>


<p>Achievement of the goals, objectives and strategies in the plan is anticipated to be
accomplished within existing resources in budget year 1997-98. As noted earlier in this
summary, however, it is also true that the Board anticipates declining resources as the
Board approaches its 50 percent diversion mandate in the year 2000. </p>

<p>In anticipation of declining resources, the Board may recommend pursuing budget options
in future years that could include some or all of the following: augmentation of the
Integrated Waste Management Account (IWMA) by revenue transfers from, or reducing revenue
transfers to, other Board funds; an increase to the IWMA by changing the Board's fee
structure; redirection of personnel or other resources; and/or a reduced level of service
based upon the priorities described by the Board's strategic goals, objectives and
strategies.</p>

<h2>Future Plans for Revisions to the Plan</h2>

<p>Performance measurement data will be collected, analyzed by Executive Staff, and
provided to the Executive Director on a quarterly basis. The status of the Board's
achievements as they relate to the measures will be reported to the Board every four
months. Based upon this data, a formal annual revision to the plan will be conducted.</p>
