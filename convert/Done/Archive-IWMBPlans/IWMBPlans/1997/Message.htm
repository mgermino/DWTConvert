<p>This <i>Strategic Plan</i> represents a major step forward for the Integrated Waste
Management Board as we continue on the path to fulfilling our legislative mandates and
reaching our vision. It is our commitment to reaching our vision, in part through the
implementation of this plan, that will further strengthen and improve the way we undertake
our mission. This plan serves as a roadmap to the future that will facilitate our efforts
in setting and achieving higher standards.</p>

<p>Proudly, this is the first strategic plan developed under the current Board's
membership, and it is also the first plan developed in a collaborative effort between the
Board Members and staff. While extensive effort has been put forth in completing this
plan, even greater Board Member and staff efforts will be required to continue the
planning process and to implement the elements embodied in it. We will continue to draw on
the many talents and the dedication of our staff in order to translate the critical issues
expressed in this plan into action. </p>

<p>Accomplishing the goals set forth in this blueprint for our future will be challenging.
Yet, it is the successful implementation of the plan's strategies that will allow us to
maintain a steady course over the next several years as we build our position as the
national and international leader in the integrated management of solid waste.</p>
