<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Board is the State agency responsible for protecting the public's health and
safety and the environment through the effective management of California's solid waste
stream. The Board encourages the conservation hierarchy of &quot;source reduction;
recycling and composting; and environmentally safe transformation and environmentally safe
land disposal.&quot; The hierarchy is needed to reach the state's goal of diverting up to
50 percent of California's solid waste from landfills by the year 2000, while at the same
time providing regulatory oversight to ensure protection of public health and safety, and
the environment.</p>

<p class="ListIntro">The Board is helping Californians reach these mandates by: 

<ul>
	<li>Developing effective relationships with local
  governments and private industry to develop and implement its programs.</li>
	<li>Educating the public about the value of resource
  conservation and the economic and environmental costs of waste disposal.</li>
	<li>Encouraging the development of markets for
  recyclable materials.</li>
	<li>Stimulating development of facilities needed to
  divert waste from disposal and provide disposal capacity for materials that cannot
  feasibly be diverted. </li>
	<li>Aggressively seeking to protect public health and
  safety, and the environment by cleaning up old, abandoned, and illegal dump sites and
  waste tire piles.</li>
</ul>

<p>The passage of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939, Chapter
1095, Statutes of 1989) marked a significant development in the way the state handles its
solid waste stream. The act set levels of waste diversion of 25 percent in 1995 and 50
percent in 2000, using 1990 baseline numbers. It laid out a strategic framework of
regulation and conservation upon which to build a monumental public effort that would
shape how Californians' perceptions of solid waste as a resource.</p>

<p>Since 1990, jurisdictions throughout California have increased the number of diversion
programs by 155 percent. More than 1,000 plans, identifying how cities and counties expect
to increase their waste reduction efforts to reach the 50 percent diversion goal, have
been submitted by local jurisdictions. California has reached an estimated 25 percent
diversion of its waste stream from landfills, achieving this goal on schedule in 1995 as
required by the act. Using financial, technical, and regulatory incentives, the Board will
continue to work extensively with local governments and private businesses to further
achieve a substantial reduction in the amount of waste sent to California landfills.</p>

<p>To facilitate the open discussion of integrated waste management issues, assist in
implementing statutory mandates, and provide a public forum for careful examination of
information from all points of view, the Board has established six committees. Each
committee is composed of three of the six board members. These committees provide a
framework to allow full review of issues and proposals prior to public hearing by the full
six-member board. This process facilitates the consideration of issues requiring in-depth
review. The committees cover the following subject areas: Administration; Local Assistance
and Planning; Legislation and Public Education; Market Development; Permitting and
Enforcement; and Policy Research and Technical Assistance.</p>

<p class="ListIntro">In addition, the Board's staff are aligned into three program divisions as follows: the
Diversion, Planning, and Local Assistance Division; the Waste Prevention and Market
Development Division; and the Permitting and Enforcement Division. The Board and executive
support functions are handled by the following four offices and one division, which report
to the Executive Director: 

<ul>
	<li>Public Affairs Office. </li>
	<li>Policy and Analysis Office. </li>
	<li>Legislative and External Affairs Office. </li>
	<li>Legal Office. </li>
<li>Administration and Finance Division.</li>
	</ul>

<h2><a name="intextsumm">Internal/External</a> Assessment Summary</h2>

<p class="ListIntro">Within the past year, several efforts have been undertaken within the Board and by the
Governor to examine the key factors that influence the success of the Board in achieving
its mission and goals, including conducting internal and external needs assessments,
developing organization and program missions, and developing priority program goals and
objectives. These efforts include the following: 

<ul>
	<li>&quot;Getting to 50 Percent&quot; Initiative. </li>
	<li>Market Development Plan. </li>
	<li>Assessment of the Tire Fund Allocation Process. </li>
	<li>&quot;The Other 50 Percent&quot; Initiative in
        Permitting and Enforcement. </li>
	<li>Waste Prevention Plan. </li>
	<li>Program Integration Plan. </li>
	<li>&quot;California Competes&quot; Initiative. </li>
	<li>Partnership 2000.</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of these initiatives, the Board has used a variety of public forums
including internal workshops, regulatory workshops, public workshops and hearings, formal
partnerships with key stakeholders, and the public forum provided by Committee and Board
hearings to obtain input on the needs of internal and external customers.</p>

<p>All of the Board's individual office and division mission statements (shown in
Appendix A); and the Board's current and recently completed planning initiatives (listed
above, and described in more detail in Appendix C), were reviewed in order to ensure
alignment of the Board's <i>Strategic Plan</i> with existing internal planning efforts.
The input received from Board staff and management during the Program Integration Plan was
utilized in the development of the draft mission and values statements. The results of all
of these efforts were integrated into the 1997 strategic planning process to ensure that
all customer input was considered and that the Board's <i>1997 Strategic Plan</i> reflects
the key strategic goals and objectives identified through the initiatives described above.</p>

<p>Following is a summary of the key internal and external challenges and
opportunities identified through the assessment and planning initiatives undertaken by the
Board in the past three-years.</p>

<h3 class="ListIntro">Internal Challenges

	<li>Potential for local and statewide economic and
        technological development and cost-savings by developing recyclable materials, industries
        and markets. </li>
	<li>Ability to support the demonstration of new,
        cost-effective and environmentally sound approaches to waste management. 
		</li>
	<li>Opportunity to foster greater integration and
        cooperation between state and local jurisdictions </li>
	<li>Contributing to the Administration and legislative
        process on environmental issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>In sum, these many challenges and opportunities serve to define the way we
understand both our internal and external client needs, and set the stage for the
development of the Board's strategic goals, objectives, and strategies.</p>
