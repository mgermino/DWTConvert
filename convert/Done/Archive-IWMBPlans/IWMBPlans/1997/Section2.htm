<h2>Introduction To Mission, Vision, And Values</h2>

<p>Since enactment of the Integrated Waste Management Act in 1989, the Board has had a
critical responsibility to create a wholesale change in the way Californians regard and
manage solid waste. In crafting the mission, the Board recognizes that its unique purpose
is to support a shift in thinking and practice that garbage is not a waste, but a resource
with the potential to strengthen the state's economy, and that this can be done while
minimizing threats to public health and safety, and the environment. </p>

<p>In developing the vision statement, the Board looks beyond the year 2000, when the
primary waste diversion mandate of 50 percent is anticipated to be achieved, and into
2001, when the Board's desired future state is to be known nationally and internationally
for its waste management expertise. Notably, the vision reflects the future outcome of the
cultural change supported in the mission: that solid waste is the sum total of valuable
materials with the potential to enhance the economic and environmental climate for the
people of California. The Board's expertise and abilities in the coming years to provide
state-of-the-art information and technical assistance regarding materials management is
how the Board believes it will succeed in attaining its vision in 2001.</p>

<p>Since the inception of the act in 1989, the Board has experienced tremendous growth in
both staff resources (from just over 70 personnel years [PY] in late 1989 to nearly 400 PY
today) and key stakeholder groups (from the traditional waste industry constituents to
unique recycling and secondary materials businesses to public schools) since the inception
of the act in 1989. In addition, many legislative amendments to the act have engendered an
ever-changing dynamic in which all Board staff must perform. These rapid changes have also
been a significant factor in how the Board views its work, particularly as they affect how
the customer or client base is defined, both internally and externally to the
organization. As a result, the Board approached the value statements with an understanding
that these ongoing changes call for integration in the Board's work and a stability and
consistency in the philosophies supported in undertaking the mission. The values serve as
the Board's vision for how this philosophy is implemented, by enhancing respect for one
another and those served by the Board, while continuously striving to improve.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Together, the vision, mission and values chart the course for the cultural change
the Board anticipates to continue through the year 2001.</p>


<h2><a NAME="Mission">Mission Statement </a></h2>

<p>The mission of an organization is a brief, concise statement that describes its unique
purpose and reason for existence. It identifies what the organization does, for whom, and
why. A mission statement reminds the public, the Governor, the Legislature, and
organization personnel of the unique purpose promoted and served by the organization.</p>

<p>This statement describes the Board's overall purpose and role, why the Board exists as
an organization, and provides the foundation for the key goals, objectives and strategies
that are described in this plan. The mission is based upon the waste management hierarchy
established in the Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939, Chapter 1095, Statutes
of 1989), and through it, the Board seeks to change how Californians perceive the
generation, management, and disposal of solid waste.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</p>
</i>
<blockquote>
	&quot;Our mission is to reduce the generation and improve the
    management of solid waste in California to conserve resources, develop sustainable
    recycling markets, and protect public health and safety, and the environment. We do this
    in partnership with public agencies, industry, business, and the public we serve.&quot;&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>The Board's mission statement was prepared within the context of the mission of the
California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA), and reflects the overarching
priority of dedication to the environment and the people of California that is the focus
of the Cal/EPA mission, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;The mission of the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) 
	is to improve environmental quality in order to protect public health, the 
	welfare of our citizens, and California's natural resources. Cal/EPA will 
	achieve its mission in an equitable, efficient, and cost-effective manner.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>&nbsp;<a NAME="Vision">Vision Statement</a></h2>

<p>A vision creates an inspiring picture of what the organization would like to become
beyond today. It is not bound by time, represents global and continuing purposes, and
serves as the foundation for the strategic planning process.</p>

<p>The vision statement describes an inspiring picture of the Board's future. It is a
continuing purpose to work toward and serves as a foundation for planning efforts.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;Our vision is that the Integrated Waste Management Board will
    be the recognized national and international leader in the integrated management of waste
    and recovered materials to best serve the public, the economy, and the environment of
    California.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a NAME="Value">Value Statement</a></h2>

<p>Values are the human factors that drive the conduct of an organization and that
function as a guide to the development and implementation of all policies and actions.
Values summarize the operating philosophies that will be used in fulfillment of the vision
and mission.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;Values are the operating principles that
    are followed in fulfillment of an organization's mission and vision. It is the
    responsibility of each member of this organization to know these values we stand for and
    to act in accordance with them.</p>

            openly and honestly. 
		<li>We recognize each others' successful
            contributions and deal constructively with our failures.</li>
	</dir>
	<p>Through acceptance of these responsibilities, we hope to deliver more than we promise
    and earn the trust and support of the people of California.&quot;</blockquote>
