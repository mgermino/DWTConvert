<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Goals, objectives, and strategies serve as a blueprint for the Board as 
it accomplishes its mission and aspires to its vision. The Goals and objectives 
represented in this plan serve to focus the efforts of the Board toward clearly 
stated issues and levels of performance. The strategies put specific actions 
into place to support the accomplishment of the Goals and objectives. Finally, 
the performance measures indicate how well the results achieved compare to the 
targets established through the Goals, objectives, and strategies. </p>
<p>One of the primary Goals of the Board is to focus the process of supporting 
the hierarchy, mandates, and objectives of the act. To this end, the waste 
hierarchy references both waste diversion mandates and the safe handling of 
solid waste for disposal. In order to most effectively focus the Board's efforts 
in these areas, it is imperative that all existing programs be evaluated and 
subsequent decisions made as to whether they contribute substantially and 
effectively to the fulfillment of the Board's mandates. This Goal and its 
accompanying objectives and strategies also communicate the need for program 
prioritization and building technical expertise internally to further the 
successful support and accomplishment of the act.</p>
<p>The Board can most effectively support local jurisdictions' ability to reach 
and maintain California's waste diversion mandates by achieving its Goal of 
either supporting jurisdictions directly, or through the promotion of waste 
reduction practices and market development to business and the public. The 
objectives and strategies of this Goal are more specifically reflected through 
the accomplishment of activities, and through existing programs such as the 
development and dissemination of tools and technical assistance, facilitating 
local jurisdictions' increased participation in waste prevention and diversion 
programs, and increasing sustainable markets for recovered materials amongst and 
across jurisdictions. </p>
<p>The Board is also focusing its efforts on programs and activities that 
directly impact the appropriate management of solid waste, and other California 
generated wastes that require special handling. This encompasses most of the 
programs being addressed in &quot;The Other 50&quot; percent Initiative through the 
Board's Permitting and Enforcement Division, as well as other programs 
throughout the Board that address the safe management of waste streams that 
require special handling, such as used oil, household hazardous wastes, tires 
and metallic discards. All of these efforts contribute to (1) preventing 
pollution from harming the environment; (2) improving the waste management 
infrastructure; and, (3) providing education, training and technical assistance 
to all of the Board's customers. </p>
<p>Key to the Board's accomplishment of its mandates is its ability to meet or 
exceed the needs of those it serves. Therefore, it is imperative that the Board 
maintain a customer focus as it carries out its mission. A concluding Goal of 
this plan is to ensure that the needs and expectations of those served by the 
Board, internally and externally, are identified and integrated into the 
processes used to develop and deliver the Board's products and services. The 
objectives and strategies furthering this Goal center on increasing levels of 
internal and external customer satisfaction, promoting program integration and 
collaborative partnerships, and not only conducting annual planning in key 
program areas but also incorporating customer requirements of those processes 
into the planning and implementation of the Board's programs and processes. The 
Board strives to maintain a high level of satisfaction among its external 
customers. It is also recognized, however, that in a regulatory environment, 
there may be instances when external customers may not be in agreement with 
Board actions or decisions. Despite this, the Board and its staff is committed 
under all circumstances to providing quality customer service.</p>
<p>Together, these Goals, objectives, strategies, and performance measures 
mutually support one another as the Board strives toward greater program 
integration and quality product and service delivery to its customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Goals</strong></h2>

<p>Goals are issue-oriented statements that reflect the realistic priorities of 
the organization and chart the future direction of the organization by focusing 
its actions toward clearly defined purposes and policy intention. Within the 
scope of the mission, Goals move the organization toward the realization of its 
vision.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">The key strategic Goals describe what the Board intends to 
accomplish and achieve by the year 2001. The Board has adopted and identified 
four fundamental Goals. By accomplishing these Goals, the Board will move closer 
to its future vision. The key strategic Goals are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To support the Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (as amended) and 
	the waste management hierarchy, mandates, and objectives the law created.</li>
	<li>To support local jurisdictions' ability to reach and maintain 
	California's waste diversion mandates.</li>
	<li>To ensure compliance with California and federal waste management 
	statutes and regulations while maximizing protection of the public health 
	and safety, and the environment.</li>
	<li>To ensure that the needs of constituents and staff are met through the 
	integrated delivery of quality products and services. The Board does this by 
	constantly evaluating its own programs for effectiveness and responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
