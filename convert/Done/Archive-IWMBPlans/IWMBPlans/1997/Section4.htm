<p><strong>Implementation Plan</p>
</strong>

<p>The Board recognizes the importance of strategic planning in laying the foundation for
its future progress. It also realizes that a practical implementation plan is vital to the
success of the organization in meeting its strategic goals. This <i>Strategic Plan</i>
provides a foundation for tactical planning efforts throughout the Board's programs and
key processes. Therefore, the immediate next step in this process is to develop a detailed
plan for implementing the Board's <i>Strategic Plan</i>. The implementation plan will
identify the tasks, programs and activities to implement the plan's strategies through the
development of individual action plans, which will identify specific responsibilities and
timeframes for delivery. Once complete, the action plans will be evaluated and presented
to the Board.</p><strong>

<p>Monitoring and Tracking Systems </p>
</strong>

<p>A monitoring and tracking system will support the Board in its ongoing strategic
management process which focuses and aligns resources and diverse programs and initiatives
to achieve optimal results. The <i>Strategic Plan</i> identifies various performance
measures which must be supported by an accurate, ongoing data collection and reporting
system. </p>

<p class="ListIntro">The Board relies on various data sources essential for measuring performance and
evaluating its programs. These systems include but are not limited to the following: 

<dir>
  <li> Workplans Information System </li>
	<li> Solid Waste Information System </li>
	<li> Training Information System </li>
	<li> Waste Generation Database </li>
	<li> Planning Annual Report Information System </li>
	<li> Used Oil Grants Information System</li>
	<li> State Buy Recycled Campaign System</li>
</dir>

<p>These key data collection systems, among others, will enable the Board to capture
data essential for the ongoing monitoring and tracking of performance.</p>

<p>Performance reports will be prepared within the appropriate programs and submitted to
the Executive Director for review quarterly. Also quarterly, the Executive Staff in
partnership with the Executive Director will be responsible for analyzing the actual
program performance achieved and assessing it against the performance goals set out in the
Strategic Plan. The outcomes of this performance measurement will be presented to the
Board every four months. Finally, so that the Strategic Plan continues to be responsive to
a changing environment, an annual review and update by the Executive Director will also be
conducted and the results presented to the Board. </p>
<h2>Resource Assumptions</h2>

<p>The Board anticipates achieving the Objectives and completing the Strategies described
in this <i>Strategic Plan</i> with existing resources. It is important to note, however,
that the Board's funding source is the Integrated Waste Management Account, not the
State's General Fund. The IWMA is funded through the solid waste tipping fees that are
collected statewide. Thus, as the Board achieves success in implementing its second
strategic goal <i>(&quot;To support local jurisdictions' ability to reach and maintain
California's waste diversion mandates&quot;</i>), it also ensures a reduction in resources
as the Board approaches the 50 percent solid waste diversion mandate in the year 2000.</p>

<p>In anticipation of these declining resources, the Board may recommend pursuing some or
all of the following options to achieve implementation of its strategic plan in future
budget years: 

<dir>
  <li>Augment the IWMA by transfers to the account, or
        by reducing fund transfers from IWMA to other Board funds. </li>
	<li>Explore the feasibility of other Board fund
        transfers where flexibility does not currently exist due to administrative caps or other
        restraints. </li>
	<li>Increase revenue to IWMA by changing the current
        fee structure.</li>
	<li>Redirect Personnel Years and other resources to
        activities that have been identified within the strategic goals.</li>
	<li>Provide a reduced level of service based upon the
        priorities identified in the Board's strategic goals, objectives, and strategies.</li>
</dir>

<p>Therefore, it is anticipated that the Board will be drafting budget change proposals to
accomplish any or all of the above options in future budget years.</p>
