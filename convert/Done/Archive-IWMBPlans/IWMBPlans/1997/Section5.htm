Program Structure</h2><h3>
Board Member Offices</h3><p>
<strong>Mission<br />
</strong>The Board members of the CIWMB and their staff provide guidance and leadership 
for the statewide implementation of the California Integrated Waste Management 
Act. The act's primary goals are to conserve natural resources by diverting 50 
percent of the solid waste going to landfills by the year 2000 and protecting 
the environment by ensuring the State's solid waste is managed effectively and 
safely.</p><p>
To achieve this, Board members provide policy and programmatic direction to 
address the State's solid waste management needs. In doing so, the Board members 
work closely with local governments, the private sector, and the interested 
public.</p><p>
Appointed by both the Governor and Legislature, Board members bring different 
perspectives to the collective decision-making process. Through open public 
hearings, Board members encourage the discussion of new ideas and ensure that

Appendix <a name="B">B</a>: Methodology Statement
</h2><p>
&nbsp;The current strategic planning effort was initiated through the formation of a 
Strategic Planning Project Core Team led by the Assistant Director, Executive 
Office, with the assistance of the supervisor of the Policy and Analysis Office 
and the Board's Quality Improvement Coordinator. This core team was responsible 
for examining the requirements of this project, developing a collaborative 
process for drafting all of the elements of the Strategic Plan, and for ensuring 
that the plan was developed in a timely and effective manner. Each of the draft 
elements was presented to the full Board, during regular monthly public 
meetings, for consideration and adoption. </p><p>
The effort to draft a vision for the Board that describes where it wants to be 
as an organization was led by the Board's Executive Director and all of the 
Board Members. Based on this input, a vision statement was drafted that 
incorporates the aspects of the future direction of the Board that are the most 
important to the leadership of this organization. The mission and value 
statements were developed by a strategic planning team that included the core 
team, along with two representatives of the Board's Executive Staff and three 
Board Member Advisors.</p><p>
The core team led the effort to draft and finalize the remaining elements 
necessary to complete the Board's 1997 Strategic Plan. Development of the key 
strategic goals was accomplished through the larger strategic planning team. 
Development of objectives, strategies, and performance measures was accomplished 
through division level workgroups, led by Division Deputy Directors and 
facilitated by members of the core team. The development of action plans will be 
accomplished through the program managers and supervisors responsible for the 
program activities targeted in the objectives and strategies. The monitoring and 
evaluation plan was drafted by the core team with the assistance of the 
strategic planning team and members of Executive Staff.</p><p>
All of the Board's current and recent planning initiatives, and all of the 
individual office and division mission statements, were reviewed in order to 
ensure alignment of the Board's Strategic Plan with existing internal planning 
efforts that incorporate both internal and external input. The input received 
from Board staff and management during the Program Integration Plan was utilized 
in the development of the draft mission and values statements. The results of 
all of these efforts were integrated into the 1997 strategic planning process to 
ensure that all input was considered and that the Board's 1997 Strategic Plan 
reflects the key strategic goals and objectives identified through the 
initiatives described above.</p><p>
Numerous other documents were considered in the development of the elements of 
the Board's 1997 Strategic Plan. These documents included key Administration 
initiatives such as the Governor's California Competes Initiative; legislative 
direction; Senate Bill 1082 (Chapter 418, Statutes of 1993) requiring the 
institution of &quot;quality government programs&quot; in all of Cal/EPA's boards and 
departments; budget language; pertinent Executive Orders issued by the Governor; 
the Cal/EPA 1996 Strategic Plan; and pertinent statutory and regulatory 
language. In this way, the Board has ensured that its Strategic Plan is in 
alignment with the goals of the Administration and the Legislature.</p>
