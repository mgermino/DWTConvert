<strong>Key Assessment And Planning Initiatives</strong></h2>
<p>Following is a more detailed discussion of the key assessment and planning 
initiatives conducted by the Board since 1994. </p><h3>
The &quot;Getting to 50 Percent&quot; Initiative</h3><p>
In order to facilitate meeting the 50 percent diversion requirement of the act, 
the Board sought input from cities and counties, the public and private waste 
management and recycling industry, manufacturers, environmental groups, the 
public, and Board staff on the issues associated with reaching the goal; 
potential solutions to obstacles; and the Board's role in achieving 50 percent 
diversion.</p><p>
A cross-functional team comprised of Board staff evaluated suggestions received 
from cities, counties and Board staff at the Board's three 50 percent Initiative 
public workshops. Approximately 1,000 suggestions were received, analyzed and 
placed into nine major categories. Within each category, suggestions with like 
themes were combined into concepts and each concept was evaluated for additional 
costs to the Board and others; demonstrated success and time to optimize the 
impact on the waste stream; and sphere of influence. Additional information was 
gathered on whether the idea was a new, expanded, or modified Board program and 
whether it would require legislative changes. The team then performed a 
screening level analysis to assist the Board in determining which of the 
suggestions received should be pursued further. Staff recommendations were 
presented to the Board for consideration at the January, 1997 Board meeting.</p><p>
The recommended concepts and strategies were assigned to Board Committees, based 
upon subject, in order to allow for more detailed analysis and discussion. 
During the March 1997 Board meeting, the Board directed staff to pursue 28 of 
the 44 original concepts/strategies proposed. These approved concepts will now 
move on to the next step in the process, and be evaluated for cost-effectiveness 
and impact to reach the 50 percent diversion requirement by the year 2000. The 
evaluation will be completed by Board staff using the strategic planning 
process. </p>
<h3>
The Market Development Plan (Excerpts from the 1996 Plan)</h3><p>
The Board adopted its first plan for market development <i>Meeting the Challenge: A 
Market Development Plan for California</i> in 1993. By late 1995, the Board 
recognized that changes in the state's economy and recycling industry 
infrastructure, as well as in the needs of local government, made revision and 
update of the 1993 plan a necessity. Additionally, developing and maintaining a 
market development plan had become a mandated activity with the passage of AB 
1909 in 1993 (PRC 42005-42009). The Board's previous plan provided general 
guidelines for implementing the Board's market development programs.</p><p>
To begin the update process, Board staff prepared reports on major secondary 
materials markets and conducted workshops to gather public comments and 
suggestions on priorities the Board should establish for its market development 
programs. The final 1996 market development plan Meeting the 50 Percent 
Challenge; Market Development Strategies Through the Year 2000, is the result of 
these activities.</p><p>
The 1996 plan was prepared with extensive public input. The proposed plan was 
circulated to interested parties for public comment, and two public workshops 
were held on June 14 and June 19, 1996. Based on comments received, the plan was 
revised to better meet the needs of local governments and businesses. The plan 
was then adopted by the Board at its publicly noticed August 28, 1996 meeting.</p><p>
The premise of the 1996 plan is that market development must address three 
closely interrelated activities, each of which is extremely sensitive to factors 
primarily affected by the private sector: collection and processing of 
materials, manufacturer use of recycled feedstock, and product marketing and 
consumer use.</p><p>
For many secondary materials and products, market development is affected by 
industry's relative inexperience with recycled feedstocks. Thus, manufacturers' 
specifications, consumer preferences and perceptions, perceived and actual 
feedstock and product quality, and public policy decisions all impact the supply 
and demand of secondary materials and products made from them.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">
The Board's market development program must consider how these complex and 
interrelated factors affect each other. The Board has consistently sought 
comments and suggestions from all participants in the market development 
community when developing and evaluating programs. Additionally, the Board 
directs that its market development programs should: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Promote partnerships among State government, business, and local governments for 
stimulating market development for recycled materials.</li>
	<li>Encourage manufacturing of value-added products whenever possible.</li>
	<li>Develop or expand self-sustaining businesses that will not be dependent on 
long-term government support.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
Assessment of the Tire Fund Allocation Process</h3><p>
The Board receives an annual appropriation from the California Tire Recycling 
Management Fund to administer the Tire Recycling Act and related legislation. 
These programs include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The waste tire market development program. </li>
	<li>The waste tire hauler registration and manifest program. </li>
	<li>The waste tire facility permitting and enforcement program.</li>
	<li>The waste tire site stabilization and remediation program.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Program implementation began in 1990 and is supported by a $0.25/tire fee paid 
by persons leaving tires for disposal with tire dealers. Recently enacted 
legislation,AB 2108 (Mazzoni), changed the point of fee collection to the point 
of retail purchase and became effective January 1, 1997. These statutory fee 
collection provisions sunset June 30, 1999, thus the program is funded for three 
remaining years (FY 96/97, 97/98, and 98/99). The projected total discretionary 
funding over this three-year timeframe is approximately $16.8 million. It should 
be noted that, while the fee collection provisions sunset in 1999, all of the 
program mandates continue.</p><p>
In the past, the Board approved tire program activities and fund allocations on 
an annual basis. Through this assessment process, the Board is working toward a 
three-year planning cycle, which will result in a more comprehensive approach to 
the alllocation of tire funding. The assessment included conducting an in-depth 
analysis of program history and funding priorities contained in the background 
paper entitled Tire Program Priorities and Funding Allocations, August 1996. In 
addition, the Board held a public workshop on September 5, 1996 to obtain input 
from a wide range of interested parties concerning their recommendations for 
tire program priorities and funding allocations. This input was used to assist 
the Board in reaching decisions concerning the allocation of program dollars and 
associated programmatic and policy decisions. Testimony was received from a 
number of industry sectors, local government representatives, representatives of 
environmental organizations, and from recognized experts in the field of waste 
tire management. </p><h3>
The &quot;Other 50 percent&quot; Initiative</h3><p>
The purpose of The Other 50 percent... A Plan for the Protection of the Public 
Health, Safety and the Environment is to describe the programs and activities of 
the Board's Permitting and Enforcement Division, which is responsible for 
activities relating to facility permitting, compliance, and enforcement, in a 
strategic way, as priorities that meet internal and external customer needs.</p><p>
The division began this planning process by preparing a Mission Statement, as 
follows: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;The mission of the Permitting and Enforcement Division is to protect the public 
and environment and to balance the concerns of the public, the regulated 
community, other government agencies, and the Board.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Within the context of internal and external customer needs, the division has 
defined its key goals and objectives for Board consideration in order to set the 
critical focus and priorities for the Board's permitting and enforcement related 
work. During the process of developing this plan, Division staff worked with its 
primary external clients and staff within the program to clarify strengths and 
opportunities. To date, the &quot;Other 50 percent&quot; Initiative is under continued 
development by the division and will incorporate the direction of the Board's 
1997 Strategic Plan into its final plan.</p><h3>
The Statewide Waste Prevention Plan (Excerpts from the 1993 Plan)</h3><p>
Waste prevention reduces waste management costs and pollution generated by 
collecting, processing, recycling, incinerating, and landfilling discards. 
Furthermore, it conserves landfill space and can add years to the expected 
lifespan of a landfill. The goal of waste prevention is not to discourage 
economic activity or job creation. It is aimed at encouraging production 
processes and consumer choices that are efficient and conserve resources.</p><p>
Waste prevention often encourages innovation and creativity. For instance, many 
businesses have found that when new ways of reducing waste and using resources 
more efficiently are identified, improved products or packaging emerge. In this 
way, waste prevention can help California businesses compete effectively in 
national and international markets. Also, many individuals and organizations 
have found creative ways to reuse items, such as refinishing old doors for 
remodeling projects, using odds and ends in sculptures and stage sets, and 
manufacturing used sails into cloth bags and clothing.</p><p>
Although waste prevention offers great potential to reduce waste, it is a 
relatively underdeveloped approach, especially when compared to traditional 
waste management practices that rely on managing discards, including recycling. 
This is not surprising because recycling offers a relatively quick and proven 
approach of diverting significant amounts of waste from landfills.</p><p>
Consequently, to encourage widespread understanding and action, the state 
Legislature mandated the Board to develop strategies to promote waste reduction.</p><p>
The Board is responsible for developing strategies to promote waste prevention 
efforts within the public and private sectors [Public Resource Code Section 
40407(f)] and is required to make recommendations for 1) legislative action to 
promote waste prevention, 2) actions to improve packaging and product design, 3) 
actions to develop and implement product durability standards, and 4) actions to 
reduce toxicity of packaging and products.</p><p>
<i>The Statewide Waste Prevention Plan</i> was prepared in response to this mandate. To 
determine what prevents program administrators from developing waste prevention 
programs and what activities the Board could undertake to facilitate 
implementation of waste prevention programs, the Board conducted extensive 
research. Information was collected using a variety of methods, including 
literature and program reviews, surveys, interviews, and two symposia focused on 
waste prevention.</p><p>
In the process, local government representatives, private sector manufacturers 
and designers, state regulators, environmental activists, educators, and 
retailers identified overriding barriers to waste prevention. The Board 
identified more than 40 activities that could be implemented to overcome those 
barriers, and prioritized those activities for implementation by the Board. 
Implementing these priority activities will not only advance waste prevention 
throughout California and acknowledge its placement at the top of the integrated 
waste management hierarchy, but will also reduce a significant portion of the 
waste stream, and reduce costs to individuals, businesses, institutions, and 
governments.</p><h3>
The Program Integration Plan</h3><p>
The Program Integration Planning (PIP) effort was initiated as a means of 
assessing and addressing issues raised regarding integration of staff work 
within the Board. Through internal and external feedback, the need to examine 
how the Board could more effectively integrate its programs was identified in 
order to improve the quality of its work and the processes and procedures used 
to accomplish the work.</p><p class="ListIntro">
The mission of the PIP is to maximize how the Board's divisions, offices, and 
programs interrelate; and to facilitate collaboration throughout the Board, 
resulting in the effective coordination of resources and efforts. The primary 
goal of the PIP is to institutionalize a participative planning and operating 
framework that enables and encourages the Board and staff to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Consistently communicate program information internally in order to more 
effectively coordinate Board efforts. </li>
	<li>Continue to build a customer focus into the way the Board does business. 
	</li>
	<li>Approach work more innovatively while constantly asking &quot;Can we do this a better 
way?&quot; </li>
	<li>Routinely build collaborative work relationships with internal and external 
customers and suppliers.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="ListIntro">
The PIP process began with the development of a mission statement by each 
section, branch, office, division, and the Board member offices. The second 
phase involved approximately 45 group interviews wherein virtually every work- 
group at the Board had the opportunity to share their thoughts about how to 
improve the work is approached and completed. Participants were asked to 
identify roadblocks to the effectiveness of their programs, and engage in group 
discussion on &quot;what works&quot;?, &quot;what doesn't work?,&quot; and &quot;what could work?,&quot; in 
promoting better communication, collaboration and customer focus within and 
among our workgroups, and with stakeholders. The major categories of roadblocks 
identified were: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Communication/Work relationships </li>
	<li>Leadership </li>
	<li>Organizational processes</li>
</ul>
<p>
The next step involved conducting focused &quot;buzz group&quot; sessions, in order to 
examine the roadblocks, issues, and concerns in more detail. The participants 
developed specific recommendations and/or identified areas for further study and 
discussion. Once all workgroup interview and buzz group data was comprehensively 
analyzed, recommendations representing staff's interests in numerous internal 
issues were developed and adopted by the Board's Executive Staff. These 
recommendations consist of activities that will facilitate the organization in 
meeting the PIP's goals and will be phased into the organization over a set 
timetable. A system for monitoring, tracking, measuring, and reporting the 
outcomes of the implementation was also instituted.</p><h3>
The &quot;California Competes&quot; Initiative</h3><p>
In response to Governor Wilson's &quot;California Competes&quot; Initiative, the Board 
inventoried all of its major program activities; determined whether or not each 
activity is a core function integral to accomplishment of its mission, or 
essential to another board or department's mission; developed performance, cost 
and quality measures for all core activities; and made recommendations on which 
programs could be transferred, outsourced, improved or retained.</p><p>
The result of this effort was the identification of 13 activity proposals for 
which implementation plans were submitted to Cal/EPA and the Governor's Office. 
The Board has been in the process of conducting the activities described in the 
implementation plans over the last year, and will continue its commitment to the 
implementation of these plans in an effort to streamline and reduce duplication 
among State programs. Monthly updates on these activities are provided to 
Cal/EPA.</p><h3>
Partnership 2000</h3><p>
Partnership 2000 is a unique working group established by the Board in 1996 to 
promote collaboration and partnership between Board staff and its Local 
Enforcement Agencies (LEA), who provide direct regulatory oversight of waste 
management facilities on behalf of the Board. The creation of this group was 
spawned by an acknowledgement by both Board management and the California 
Conference of Directors of Environmental Health (CCDEH) on behalf of the LEAs 
that the working relationships between the parties had suffered due to differing 
interpretations of waste related laws and regulations as well as lack of clarity 
in roles and responsibilities.</p><p>
The vision of this special collaboration is for the Board and the LEAs (working 
through CCDEH) to work in partnership and collaborate in the identification and 
resolution of issues with the goal of improving the mutual effectiveness of both 
parties in meeting solid waste management legislative mandates.</p><p>
The mission of Partnership 2000 is to develop a positive working relationship 
whereby the Board and CCDEH set an agenda to clarify state and local roles and 
responsibilities; to facilitate communication and collaboration; and to secure a 
commitment from all levels to work together so mutual program and policy 
objectives can be met.</p><p>
Through the utilization of a problem-solving process that identifies underlying 
interests of parties in order to achieve options and agreements for mutual gain, 
the members of Partnership 2000 provided identification of the key strengths and 
challenges of the Board and its LEA partners as related to the provision of 
appropriate enforcement actions for solid waste facilities.</p><p>
The results to date have included a first-ever collaboration between Board staff 
and LEAs in the development of the Board Permitting and Enforcement Policy, a 
new Integrated Training Team to improve the process for delivery of Board 
training, as well as enhanced working relationships between the respective 
staffs, among other outcomes.</p><p>
This partnership is ongoing. In addition to Partnership 2000, Board staff 
continually work with all LEAs (including those not represented by CCDEH) 
through the Enforcement Advisory Council (EAC) as a forum to raise issues of 
mutual interest. Together, these activities build on the previous identification 
of internal and external challenges and opportunities as they relate to the 
Board's regulatory responsibilities, so that the Board's ability to achieve 
mutual policy and mandate objectives with its partners is continuously improved.</p><h2>
Appendix <a name="D">D</a>: Glossary Of Terms </h2><p>
Following are brief definitions of each of the Strategic Planning elements 
required in a Strategic Plan.</p><p>
<strong>Vision Statement</strong> - A vision creates an inspiring picture of what the 
organization would like to become beyond today. It is not bound by time, 
represents global and continuing purposes, and serves as the foundation for the 
strategic planning process.</p><p>
<strong>Mission Statement</strong> - The mission of an organization is a brief, concise statement 
that describes its unique purpose and reason for existence. It identifies what 
the organization does, for whom and why. A mission statement reminds the public, 
the Governor, the Legislature, and organization personnel of the unique purpose 
promoted and served by the organization.</p><p>
<strong>Values</strong> - Values are the human factors that drive the conduct of an organization 
and that function as a guide to the development and implementation of all 
policies and actions. Values summarize the operating philosophies that will be 
used in fulfillment of the vision and mission.</p><p>
<strong>Goals</strong> - Goals are issue-oriented statements that reflect the realistic 
priorities of the organization and chart the future direction of the 
organization by focusing its actions toward clearly defined purposes and policy 
intention. Within the scope of the mission, goals move the organization toward 
the realization of its vision.</p><p>
<strong>Objectives</strong> - Objectives are specific and measurable targets for the 
accomplishment of a goal. They mark interim steps toward achievement of the 
mission and goals. An objective is achievable, measurable, and sets the 
direction for strategies and action plans.</p><p>
<strong>Strategies</strong> - Strategies are specific courses of action that will be undertaken 
by the organization to accomplish it goals and objectives. Strategies are 
action-oriented rather than procedural in nature and are directly linked to 
output measures.</p><p>
<strong>Action Plans</strong> - Action plans are the specific workplans that will be used to 
accomplish the organization's goals, objectives, and strategies.</p><p>
<strong>Performance Measures</strong> - Performance measures are indicators of the work performed 
and the results achieved. They describe, in both quantifiable and qualitative 
terms, how well the activities and processes within an organization are 
achieving specified goals and objectives and strategies. Measures are the most 
effective means to obtain and understand performance feedback.</p><p>
<strong>Monitoring and Evaluation Plan</strong> - This is the system used to regularly measure 
and evaluate the effectiveness of the organization's performance results 
relative to the strategic plan. The plan is revised in accordance with the 
results of this ongoing evaluation.</p>
