<h2><a name="About">About Us</a></h2>
<p>The Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939, Sher, Chapter 1095, Statutes of
1989, as amended [AB 939]) created the California Integrated Waste Management
Board (CIWMB, Board). With the establishment of the Board came a series of
statewide reforms in waste management. AB 939 established the 50 percent
diversion goal for local government based on an integrated waste management
hierarchy that prioritized waste reduction and recycling over all other options.
It inspired a renewed &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&quot; ethic and enhanced public
outreach programs and environmental education curricula to spread the word. AB
939 also improved landfill safety requirements and protection for public health
and the environment. These core programs have been strengthened with the
addition of fee-based programs to improve recycling of used motor oil and the
management of waste tires.</p>
<p>The Board consists of <a href="/BoardInfo/BoardMembers/"> six members</a>: four appointed by the Governor, and one
each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly. To ensure a
broad range of expertise, one of the Governor’s appointees must have
private-sector experience in the waste industry, and a second must have
experience in the nonprofit environmental community.</p>
<p>The CIWMB is organized into five divisions and six offices, with
approximately 509 employees conducting more than 90 programmatic activities. The
five divisions are: Administration and Finance; Diversion, Planning, and Local
Assistance; Permitting and Enforcement; Special Waste; and Waste Prevention and
Market Development. The six offices are: Legislative Affairs; Public Affairs;
Legal; Policy and Analysis; Integrated Education; and Organizational
Effectiveness. The CIWMB is part of the <a href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov/"> California Environmental Protection
Agency</a> (Cal/EPA).</p>
<h2><a name="Plan">About Our Strategic Plan</a></h2>
<p>The Board’s strategic planning process and resulting road map, as
represented in this plan, was initiated early this year. Cal/EPA’s <i> Strategic
Vision</i>, published in late 2000, established the framework for the development of
the CIWMB's 2001 Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>The plan lays out key areas the Board will address over the next three to
five years and describes a shift in focus from the AB 939 diversion goals to a
broader, more systematic approach to managing the materials used and created in
manufacturing. This shift includes a commitment to working with manufacturers on
product stewardship, so that we are working toward achieving a sustainable
society. Throughout the development of this plan, input on key strategic trends
and issues was gathered from a broad representation of internal and external
stakeholders. The Board synthesized this input and prioritized the actions and
strategies that were proposed to ensure that Board resources will be allocated
to these key areas. Next steps include formation of strategic teams to develop
more detailed action plans, development of program performance measures, and
implementation of the key strategies described in the plan. Additionally, staff
will report to the Board during Board meetings on a quarterly basis on the
progress made in each goal area, as well as providing an annual review and
update to the Board of progress and the need for revisions to the plan. The
Board will continue to build in stakeholder input during this process through
public meetings and workshops.</p>
<p>As with the Board’s 1997 plan, the 2001 plan will be a living document that
is used as the basis for allocating staff resources, preparing the annual
budget, and allocating contract funds, and in the development of legislative
proposals. Thus, the intended audience for this plan includes the staff of all
of the Cal/EPA boards, departments, and office, other State agencies and
departments, the Legislature, and external stakeholders.</p>
<h2><a name="Priorities">Our Priorities</a></h2>
<p>The Board’s strategic priorities are based upon the mandates contained in
AB 939, which include diversion of waste from landfills based on a hierarchy
that prioritized waste reduction and recycling over all other options; enhancing
public outreach programs and environmental education in schools; improving
landfill safety; and protecting public health and safety along with the
environment. A more detailed discussion of why these goals were chosen and what
we hope to achieve in each of these areas is contained in the section of this
plan entitled “Our Goals, Objectives, and Strategies.” Following are the
Board’s seven strategic goals:</p>
<p>1. Increase participation in resource conservation, integrated waste
management, waste prevention, and product stewardship to reduce waste and create
a sustainable infrastructure.</p>
<p>2. Assist in the creation and expansion of sustainable markets to support
diversion efforts and ensure that diverted materials return to the economic
mainstream.</p>
<p>3. Educate the public to better understand and participate in resource
conservation and integrated waste management strategies.</p>
<p>4. Manage and mitigate the impacts of solid waste on public health and safety
and the environment, and promote integrated and consistent permitting,
inspection, and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>5. Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Integrated Waste
Management Board in pursuit of its mission.</p>
<p>6. Continuously integrate environmental justice concerns into all of the
Board’s programs and activities, including administrative and budgetary
decisions.</p>
<p>7. Promote a &quot;zero-waste California&quot; where the public, industry, and
government strive to reduce, reuse, or recycle all municipal solid waste
materials back into nature or the marketplace in a manner that protects human
health and the environment and honors the principles of California’s
Integrated Waste Management Act.</p>
<h2><a name="Achieve">How We Will Achieve Our Priorities</a></h2>
<p>Our purpose in preparing this strategic plan was to create a blueprint for
the Board to guide our efforts through the next three to five years. We have
mapped a path from the present to our vision of the future by assessing the
challenges we face and the capabilities and needs of our organization, and by
articulating specific strategies designed to move us toward our goals. In some
cases we will be continuing work already in progress, and in other cases we will
be breaking new ground. We hope to achieve our priorities by forming
cross-functional work teams that will prepare detailed work plans for
implementation in each goal area. Work progress will be tracked both through
reports to the Board and executive management, as well as through the
development of program performance measures and environmental indicators.</p>
<h2><a name="Indicators">Environmental Indicators</a></h2>
    <p>As part of the implementation of Cal/EPA’s <i> Strategic Vision</i>,
    environmental indicators are being developed under the Environmental
    Protection Indicators for California (EPIC) project. These environmental
    indicators will provide a means of assessing trends associated with Cal/EPA’s
    mission and will serve as a foundation for building a results-based
    management system for the Agency.</p>
    <p>An environmental indicator is a measure that presents scientifically
    based information on the status of, and trends in, environmentally related
    parameters. Environmental indicators reflect pressures exerted on the
    environment by human activities or ambient environmental conditions, or
    effects on human or ecological health.</p>
    <p>The EPIC project has adopted a process to identify, select, and develop
    environmental indicators. Using this process, an initial set of indicators
    has been generated. These will be incorporated into a report to be submitted
    to the Agency Secretary by the end of 2001.</p>
    <p>The EPIC indicators will be linked to Strategic Goals 1 through 6 in the
    Cal/EPA Strategic Vision document, thus illustrating how programs
    implemented, or data collected by a board or department, may relate to these
    goals.</p>
    <p>The indicators proposed for the “Land, Waste, and Materials Management”
    section of the EPIC report cover waste generation and diversion, disposal to
    land, site contamination, and cross-media contamination.</p>
