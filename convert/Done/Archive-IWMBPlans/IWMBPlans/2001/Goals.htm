    <p>The following goals reflect the realistic priorities of the Board that we
    believe will move us toward achieving our vision and mission. Through these
    goals, we are charting our future direction toward several clearly defined
    policies that include incorporating the principles of sustainability, zero
    waste, and market development strategies into our priorities, as well as
    addressing protection of public health and the environment. The objectives
    and strategies mark interim steps toward achieving our goals.</p>
    <p>These goals, objectives, and strategies have been developed within the
    context of <a href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov/Publications/Reports/StratPlans/2000/">Cal/EPA's
    <i> Strategic
    Vision</i></a>, and they support and actively seek
    to implement the goals and objectives included in the vision. A description
    of how each of the Board’s goals aligns with and supports and implements
    Ca/EPA’s Strategic Vision is included at the end of each section on the
    Board’s goals.</p>
<h2><a name="Participation">Goal 1</a>—Increase participation in resource conservation, integrated waste
management, waste prevention, and product stewardship to reduce waste and create
a sustainable infrastructure.</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Many of the concepts incorporated in this goal are integral aspects of
    the day-to-day work at CIWMB. However, this goal would expand our efforts
    and put a greater emphasis on businesses and the partnerships necessary to
    reach our vision of a sustainable California. With this goal and the
    objective and strategies that follow, we will cause resource conservation
    and waste prevention activities to be recognized as financially viable, as
    well as environmentally sound.</p>
    <p>Through partnerships with businesses, associations, and State and federal
    agencies, we will strengthen our commitment toward product stewardship. This
    principle ensures that all actors along the product chain share
    responsibility for life-cycle environmental impacts and the financial
    viability of the whole product system. We will achieve this by calling for
    each actor in the life cycle of products and services to take voluntary
    actions to maximize environmental, social, and economic performance, and to
    minimize environmental and health impacts through implementation of the
    interrelated principles of extended product responsibility, product
    stewardship, pollution prevention, and sustainable development. The success
    of these principles will lead us to a business infrastructure that will
    continue these practices because it is simply “good business.”</p>
    <p>Extended product responsibility and product stewardship challenge us to
    reduce the environmental effects of products throughout their life cycle. In
    doing so, these principles tap the shared ingenuity and responsibility of
    business, consumers, government, and others. Pollution prevention avoids
    creating waste in the first place and prevents the transfer of pollution
    from one environmental medium (air, water, or land) to another. Sustainable
    development is the global concept of meeting the needs of the present
    without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
    needs through the “three Es”--actions that are economically sound,
    environmentally restorative, and socially and generationally equitable. By
    adopting these principles, we will be moving from conflict to cooperation in
    order to achieve a sustainable California.</p>
    <h3>Goal 1, Objective 1: Promote environmentally sound and financially viable
    waste prevention and materials management practices among all actors in the
    life cycle of products and services.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Encourage each actor in the life cycle of all products and
        services to voluntarily commit to sustainability and stewardship
        principles.</li>
  <li>Promote sustainable management practices for businesses with the
        purpose of helping them make efficient use of resources, reduce waste,
        and minimize impacts on human health and the environment.</li>
  <li>Support third-party life cycle assessment for targeted products
        and alternative packaging materials.</li>
  <li>Identify, develop, and maintain partnerships to reduce waste and
        promote resource conservation and product stewardship, including
        participating in national efforts on materials such as carpet, <a href="/Electronics/Stewardship/">electronics</a>, and paint.</li>
  <li>Promote self-assessment by businesses and households of their
        waste prevention practices.</li>
  <li>Educate the public, the private sector, and government about
        product stewardship and responsible consumerism.</li>
  <li>Promote the financial benefits of marketing environmentally
        preferable products and services.</li>
  <li>Enact policies and programs to distribute responsibility for the
        full cost of products and services over their life cycle to ensure that
        any one party does not bear any undue costs.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 1 Alignment With Cal/EPA Vision</h3>
    <p>The intent of this goal is to promote waste prevention and product
    stewardship and resource conservation management practices. The Board’s
    objective and strategies tie directly to Cal/EPA’s <i> Strategic Vision</i> goals
    by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a plan for a sustainable California (Goal 8).</li>
  <li>Encouraging personal and corporate responsibility through
        increased education and outreach (Goals 6 and 8).</li>
  <li>Promoting the implementation of Environmental Management Systems
        (EMS) (Goal 8).</li>
  <li>Developing and using meaningful environmental performance
        indicators (Goal 8).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Markets">Goal 2</a><a name="Participation">—</a>Assist in the creation and expansion of sustainable markets to support diversion efforts and ensure that diverted materials return to the economic
mainstream.</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In implementing its 1997 Strategic Plan, the Board created priority
    teams, two of which centered on market development for materials that
    comprise major portions of the waste stream: organic materials, and
    construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris. The <a href="/Organics/GreenTeam/"> “greening” team</a>
    focused on diversion outreach programs, partnerships, and demonstrations of
    the benefits of recycling and composting of organic materials. The C &amp; D
    team’s efforts evolved into the current <a href="/GreenBuilding/"> sustainable building
    program</a>.
    These efforts assisted local jurisdictions in reaching a 42 percent average
    diversion rate. To achieve and exceed the 50 percent diversion goal,
    however, we must continue to create and expand markets that are predictable
    and sustainable over the long term.</p>
    <p>This goal and the objectives that follow are directly tied to Cal/EPA’s
    vision of preventing pollution and developing a sustainable California by
    returning valuable materials into the economic mainstream rather than
    wasting them in landfills. Achieving the objectives through partnerships
    with local entities and industry, leadership by the State, and education of
    all concerned will move us from a “supply push” situation, where
    materials are collected even when markets are not sufficient, to a more
    sustainable “supply pull” situation based on expanded market demand.</p>
    <h3>Goal 2, Objective 1: Lead the State in developing a comprehensive
    framework for management of priority materials.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Build on the principles and strategies in the U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency’s Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Program to
        increase procurement of environmentally preferable products through
        executive order, legislation, education, and market expansions.</li>
  <li>Lead in “greening” all <a href="/StateAgency/"> State agencies</a> by providing technical
        expertise in waste diversion, buy recycled, sustainable building,
        sustainable landscaping, and related programs.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 2, Objective 2: Encourage the use of materials diverted from
    California landfills and the use of environmentally preferable practices,
    products, and technologies.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Foster innovative markets in sustainable building and landscaping,
        sustainable agriculture, and energy generation.</li>
  <li>Provide <a href="/Grants/"> financial incentives</a>, including grants, contracts, loans,
        tax credits, etc.</li>
  <li>Recognize outstanding and/or innovative market development, waste
        diversion, and buy recycled efforts.</li>
  <li>Require recipients of grants, contracts, loans, and other
        financial incentives to meet Board criteria such as purchasing
        environmentally preferable products, constructing sustainable buildings,
        and practicing sustainable landscaping.</li>
  <li>Facilitate research and information transfer on new technologies
        and environmentally preferable product specifications.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 2, Objective 3: Support local jurisdictions’ ability to reach and
    maintain California’s waste diversion mandates.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Work with manufacturers to promote the design and development of
        products and packaging that use recycled and/or reused manufacturing
        feedstock, and that are either reusable in their original form or
        recyclable in subsequent production cycles.</li>
  <li>Partner with universities to educate the next generation of
        professionals on pollution prevention, sustainable landscaping,
        sustainable agriculture, sustainable building, and design for the
        environment.</li>
  <li>Facilitate cooperative efforts among State, local, and private
        entities to lower the cost of diversion and increase its benefits to
        local jurisdictions.</li>
  <li>Assess and assist local governments’ efforts to implement
        programs and reduce disposal, taking corrective action as needed.</li>
  <li>Provide assistance and education to local governments, businesses,
        schools, and State facilities to implement and assess programs.</li>
  <li>Support local government efforts to use alternative means of
        diverting waste, including the use of conversion technology where
        residuals can be converted directly into electricity and actively
        managed to increase fuel and gas production.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 2 Alignment With Cal/EPA Vision</h3>
    <p>The Board’s efforts to increase markets and promote sustainable,
    economic diversion throughout the state dovetail with the Governor’s
    energy policies and support Cal/EPA’s <i> Strategic Vision</i> goals by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Promoting a “green” Cal/EPA and leading the effort to “green”
        California State government (Goals 6 and 8).</li>
  <li>Promoting the commercialization and use of effective practices,
        products, and technologies that benefit the environment and local
        communities (Goals 5 and 7).</li>
  <li>Tackling “cross-media” air, water, and energy issues that cut
        across traditional boundaries, thereby preventing pollution and
        magnifying the benefits of better materials management (Goals 1, 2, 3,
        6, and 8).</li>
  <li>Encouraging personal and corporate responsibility through
        increased education and outreach (Goals 6 and 8).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Educate">Goal 3</a><a name="Participation">—</a>Educate the public to better understand and participate in resource conservation and integrated waste management strategies.</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Board is a confirmed leader in educating the public through extensive
    outreach, including fairs and festivals, workshops, trade shows, and other
    public events. More than 450 fact sheets, brochures, reports, and other
    publications are <a href="/Publications/"> available in print and on-line</a>. The Board’s award-winning
    Web site offers valuable information for a variety of audiences, including
    business, local government, nonprofit organizations, academia, and other
    State and federal agencies, as well as the public. An outstanding outreach
    and education program provides information to a broad range of Californians.</p>
    <p>The Board forges partnerships with nonprofit associations, other
    government agencies, and legislative advocates, promoting networking with
    our constituents. We are a leader in information technology, offering our
    constituents user-friendly tools such as the <a href="/LGCentral/AnnualReport/Sample/"> electronic annual report</a> (EAR)
    system now available on line. We are taking steps to make existing and new
    products available on line either for downloading and/or interactive
    learning by teachers and students. Our leadership in the field of education
    has been enhanced by the creation of the <a href="/Schools/">Office of
    Education and the Environment </a>in
    March 2001 to promote the integration of education efforts within the Board
    and within and among the Cal/EPA boards, departments, and offices. This
    effort will provide opportunities to consolidate and collaborate in
    providing quality education resources and technical support to K-12
    educators statewide.</p>
    <p>Education is the cornerstone of our mission and vision. Education
    motivates constituents to realize the potential economic benefits and
    environmental opportunities of waste prevention/reduction and recycling. Our
    education efforts focus on assisting communities to protect the public
    health and encourage environmental stewardship. The contributions and
    efforts of millions of Californians are essential to the success of our
    mission. Thus, education is our investment in the future.</p>

    <h3>Goal 3 Alignment With Cal/EPA Vision</h3>
    <p>The Board’s efforts in the area of public education and outreach align
    with and support Cal/EPA’s <i> Strategic Vision</i> goals by focusing on expanding
    accessibility of information to the public through the Internet and
    expanding communication and training efforts (Goal 8).</p>
<h2><a name="Protect">Goal 4</a><a name="Participation">—</a>Manage and mitigate the impacts of solid waste on public health and safety and the environment and promote integrated and consistent permitting, inspection, and enforcement efforts.</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This goal encompasses much of the longstanding, statutorily mandated work
    at solid waste and tire sites that has been embedded in each of the Board’s
    strategic plans. Many Board staff members are currently working to ensure
    that we continue to meet the statutory mandates for protecting public health
    and safety and the environment. These statutes call for the Board to have
    and maintain permitting, inspection, and enforcement programs. The Board’s
    oversight programs that protect public health and safety and the environment
    directly were audited and the Board is working to affect needed changes.
    Many of the strategies outlined below will help direct further changes.</p>
    <p>This goal allows for appropriate growth in ideas and methods that will
    result in a higher level of protection of public health and safety and the
    environment by the State and its local enforcement agencies. In addition to
    monitoring and managing activities associated with the State’s active
    solid waste infrastructure, the Board added waste tire and disposal site
    clean up programs during the 1990s. As programs grow and change, the
    Board can seek to expand the existing avenues for accomplishing the “cleanup”
    aspects of this goal. Further, with the advent of environmental management
    systems concepts, the Board can also achieve this goal through research,
    outreach, and education in the areas of “best business” practices.</p>
    <p>This goal supports the Board’s mission by ensuring an infrastructure is
    available for managing materials and waste in an environmentally sound
    manner. The strategies allow for flexibility in promoting diversion while
    working to protect public health and safety and the environment. To this
    end, environmental protection afforded by this goal should not only preserve
    the environment, but also, where possible, restore it. This concept aligns
    with the Board’s vision to promote zero waste by ensuring regulations do
    not impede the growth of diversion activities and identifying methods to
    restore the environment when pollution has occurred.</p>
    <p>The lack of solid waste infrastructure, different levels of regulatory
    oversight, and cultural variations among border communities present a
    challenge to the Board in addressing environmental impacts arising from the
    management of solid waste within the California-Mexico border zone.
    Realizing the magnitude of this challenge, and in alignment with Cal/EPA’s
    vision, the Board will work cooperatively with all levels of government
    along both sides of the border in addressing four border-specific concerns:
    (a) hauling/stockpiling of waste tires along border cities; (b)
    sharing/disseminating of environmental education materials; (c) preventing
    the northerly flow of solid waste debris along the Tijuana and the New
    River; and (d) offering technical assistance to Mexican neighboring
    communities in the process of siting or upgrading their solid waste disposal
    sites.</p>

    and the environment.</p>
<h2><a name="ZeroWaste">Goal 7</a><a name="Participation">—</a>Promote a “zero-waste California” where the public, industry, and government strive to reduce, reuse, or recycle all municipal solid waste materials back into nature or the marketplace in a manner that protects human health and the environment and honors the principles of California’s
Integrated Waste Management Act.</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The zero-waste philosophy focuses on the most efficient use of natural
    resources in order to maximize the reduction of waste and protect the
    environment. It also includes but is not limited to maximizing recycling and
    ensuring that products are made to be reused, repaired, or recycled back
    into the environment. Zero-waste involves utilizing the most effective
    industry processing or manufacturing practices to efficiently conserve the
    use of raw materials, including front-end design for efficiency while
    educating consumers. It includes promoting technology to encourage source
    reduction on the front end and recycling and other technologies on the back
    end, and harnessing the energy potential in “waste” by using new and
    clean technology to convert the material directly into green fuel or gas to
    produce electricity. Board efforts in this area have resulted in “real”
    reduced amounts of disposal since 1989, as measured by the Board’s
    disposal reporting system. Some of the Board’s work that has contributed
    to reductions in disposed waste are promotion of <a href="/Packaging/"> packaging
    redesign</a>, <a href="/FoodWaste/"> food
    waste</a> projects, <a href="/Organics/"> organics diversion</a> efforts, work with local jurisdictions
    and local businesses, the <a href="/CalMAX/"> California Materials Exchange</a> (CalMAX) program,
    the <a href="/WRAP/"> Waste Reduction Awards Program</a> (WRAP), and <a href="/GreenBuilding/"> green building</a> projects.</p>
    <p>This goal is very consistent and closely aligned with the Board’s
    overall mission that promotes all materials being managed to the highest and
    best use. By supporting effective and efficient industry processing and
    manufacturing practices, the Board will strive to create a sustainable
    California preserved for the future. By working closely with local
    jurisdictions and local businesses, the CIWMB will continue to form
    partnerships that supporting this overall effort. The Board is committed to
    promoting its overall vision by recognizing the diversity of the state and
    partnering with its external customers.</p>
    <h3>Goal 7, Objective 1: Promote source reduction to minimize the amount of
    waste generated.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Periodically review existing and proposed regulations and
        legislation for possible barriers to attaining the existing mandates and
        the goal of zero-waste diversion.</li>
  <li>Continue to work with jurisdictions to ensure they meet and/or
        exceed existing waste diversion mandates.</li>
  <li>Continue to educate the public regarding the principles,
        obstacles, and opportunities of zero waste.</li>
  <li>Develop and use meaningful environmental and performance
        indicators.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 7, Objective 2: Promote best business practices in product
    manufacturing and handling.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Partner with other State agencies to create cross-media approaches
        to working with business to assist in achieving zero waste.</li>
  <li>Partner with trade associations to promote cost-beneficial source
        reduction, recycling, and related manufacturing opportunities
        (technologies, packaging efficiencies, best business practices, etc.).</li>
  <li>Create model programs that are self-sustaining and transferable to
        others.</li>
  <li>Evaluate long-term benefits of pilot programs or models.</li>
  <li>Expand and develop interactive Web sites that can be used by all.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 7, Objective 3: Encourage recycling activities and new technologies
    in all businesses and residences.</h3>
      <p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Assemble a cross-media team to develop standards for evaluating
        new technologies that produce less waste and convert residuals to their
        highest and best use.</li>
  <li>Use high-profile public venues as demonstration projects to
        promote the zero-waste message. As part of the evaluation process,
        assess the commitment of owners/managers of these venues to ensure
        sustainable programs.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 7, Objective 4: Promote new or existing technologies and processes to
    address existing or emerging waste streams.</h3>

        Campaign and AB 75</a> (Strom-Martin, Chapter 764, Statutes of 1999)
        programs to ensure statutory compliance.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Goal 7 Alignment With Cal/EPA Vision</h3>
    <p>The intent of this goal is to promote a zero-waste California that
    strives to maximize the reduction of waste. This particular goal is very
    broad in scope and essentially encompasses all diversion-related activities
    and processes related to the public, industry, and government. Five specific
    objectives were created that emphasized source reduction, recycling, best
    business practices, new technologies, and providing leadership within State
    government.</p>
    <p>Additionally, strategies for accomplishing this goal include such
    activities as, creating partnerships with State agencies and business,
    promoting environmental management systems, projecting future waste streams,
    and many other activities. Many of the proposed objectives within this goal
    are very similar to or consistent with Cal/EPA's <i> Strategic Vision</i> goals.</p>
