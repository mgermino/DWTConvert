<h2><a name="Chair">Message From the Chair</a></h2>
    <p>California’s 11-year experiment in waste stream diversion has been, by
    nearly all accounts, a resounding success. Over 180 million tons of
    materials have been diverted from landfills over this period. Local
    jurisdictions have met, or are well on the way to achieving, the Legislature’s
    goal of cutting waste entering landfills in half. As we near and cross the
    “goal line,” we must ask, “What next?” Or, in response to the
    changing waste stream that has evolved from the tremendous diversion efforts
    of local jurisdictions, “What’s left?”</p>
    <p>Clearly, the Board’s work is not done. An estimated 38 million tons of
    California-generated waste are still being disposed annually, only six
    percent of which is being converted into energy. Local jurisdictions-urban
    and rural-continue to seek State support in developing reliable, long-term
    markets for diverted materials. And many cities and counties will need extra
    time and help to achieve the 50 percent diversion goal.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, the Board is committed to the principles of
    sustainability—meeting the needs of the present without compromising the
    ability of future generations to meet their own needs; product
    stewardship—ensuring that all parties involved in producing, selling, or
    using a product take responsibility for the full environmental and economic
    impacts of that product; and zero waste—striving towards maximum waste
    reduction through the most efficient use of natural resources and materials
    and maximizing recycling. It is important that the Board’s future efforts
    focus on the changing waste stream, where <a href="/FoodWaste/"> food wastes</a> and
    <a href="/Electronics/"> electronic wastes</a>
    (e-waste) are more prevalent today than they were yesterday and new
    challenges are emerging as a consequence of population growth, new
    technologies, and changes in consumer preferences.</p>
    <p>Changing how we think about waste-an inefficiently used resource-alters
    our perception about how to handle it. For example, burying nearly 40
    million tons of trash in landfills annually squanders a renewable energy
    resource. Using new and clean technology to convert the material directly
    into green fuel or gas to produce electricity or actively managing its
    decomposition to increase gas production for electrical generation can
    harness the energy potential in “waste.” Such <a href="/Organics/Conversion/"> harnessing of energy</a> can
    and should be done to more efficiently utilize materials that have no other
    economic value. This should be done without impacting current recycling or
    composting infrastructures.</p>

<h2><a name="Board">Message From the Board</a></h2>
    <p>A strategic plan is only as good as its results. Judging by California’s
    materials diversion record over the past three years, the California
    Integrated Waste Management Board’s 1997 Strategic Plan was on target.
    That plan prioritized the Board’s resources and actions to help cities and
    counties meet the 50 percent diversion goal the Integrated Waste Management
    Act set for 2000. Coupled with the continued efforts of local jurisdictions,
    the Board’s efforts helped produce a 65 percent jump in diversion from
    1997 to 2000. Calculations based on California’s disposal reporting system
    found an estimated 28 million tons diverted in 2000, boosting California’s
    statewide diversion rate to 42 percent.</p>
    <p>This 2001 Strategic Plan serves as a road map to the future that will
    guide our efforts in setting and achieving yet higher standards. Input from
    stakeholders representing various groups and interests-both internal and
    external-contributed to the focus and strategic direction of this plan. We
    will continue to draw on the many talents and dedication of our staff to
    translate into action the critical issues identified in this document.</p>
    <p>Key themes in this 2001 Strategic Plan are sustainability, product
    stewardship, energy recovery, environmental justice, and safe disposal of
    waste. As we look ahead, we must focus on changing not only our actions, but
    also our very understanding about resources. Waste is a resource that
    Californians are using inefficiently. As natural resource stewards, our aim
    is toward a zero-waste philosophy which focuses on the most efficient use of
    our natural resources in order to reduce waste and protect the environment.
    The Board is committed to working in partnership with local government,
    private businesses, and product manufacturers to develop a future modeled on
    resource stewardship and waste minimization.</p>

<h2><a name="ED">Message From the Executive Director</a></h2>
<p>It used to be that what you threw in the garbage was no one’s business but
your own. Not anymore. California’s waste management infrastructure was
retooled in response to the State’s 1989 Integrated Waste Management Act,
which challenged each city and county to divert from landfill disposal
one-quarter of the waste generated within its jurisdiction by 1995, and one-half
by the year 2000.</p>
<p>We have responded by increasing the diversion of materials out of the waste
stream and away from landfills, from an estimated five million tons in 1989 to
more than 28 million tons in 2001, more than 200 million tons in all. Statewide,
we reached a diversion level of 42 percent last year, a remarkable achievement
in the face of the state’s sagging economy and rising population. We have
started our review of diversion measurements taken by local governments to see
if they’ve reached the 50 percent diversion mark the Legislature set for 2000.
We expect that as many as half of the state’s 535 cities and counties will
meet that goal.</p>
<p>California has an economy larger than most countries in the world, and the
amount of garbage buried in our landfills puts us near the top of that list as
well. When it comes to finding alternatives to landfill disposal, we must be
uniquely progressive as we continue to promote California’s waste reduction
hierarchy—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Buy Recycled.</p>
<p>In looking to the next ten years, this strategic plan provides a blueprint
upon which to refocus our vision for the future. It looks at critical strategies
that will guide the Board in its decision-making to meet the demands of the 21st
century.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone involved—internal and external—who helped in
developing this plan. This is a living document which we will use daily as we
chart our future.</p>
