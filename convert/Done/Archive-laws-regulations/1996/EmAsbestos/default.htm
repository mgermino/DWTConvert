<title>Asbestos-Containing Waste Emergency Regulations: Rulemaking Archives</title>
<meta name="Description" content="Owner or operator of a non-Class I landfill that accepts 
asbestos-containing waste must meet the requirements of this California Integrated Waste Management Board regulation. The regulation makes operation
conditional on two requirements. The first condition is that the landfill
has obtained WDRs from the Regional Water Quality Control Board that allow
the disposal of asbestos containing waste. Second, the landfill must meet
the specific conditions listed in the regulation. These emergency regulations were
approved by the Office of Administrative Law on August 1, 1996 and became effective on that same date.">
