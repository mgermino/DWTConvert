<p>July 26, 1996 </p>

<p>To: All Assembly Bill (AB) 1220 Interested Parties </p>

<p>TRANSMITTAL OF CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT BOARD (CIWMB)/STATE WATER
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (SWRCB) NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING FOR AB 1220 PROPOSED
REGULATIONS </p>

<p>Enclosed for your review are the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking for CIWMB and SWRCB
proposed regulations implementing AB 1220 (Chapter 656, Statutes of 1993). AB 1220
requires reduction of overlap, duplication, and conflict among the CIWMB, SWRCB, and Local
Enforcement Agencies. The modified regulatory language will be moved from Title 14 and
Chapter 15 of Title 23 and placed in Title 27 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).
This includes all requirements for discharges of solid waste to land from Chapter 15.
Requirements for discharges of hazardous waste to land will remain in Chapter 15. </p>

<p>The formal notice of the proposed rulemaking is on July 26, 1996. The scope of the
regulations is primarily limited to AB 1220 implementation. Both the SWRCB and the CIWMB
may consider making substantive changes in future rulemakings. </p>

<p>Please note that if you have previously requested to receive the proposed regulations,
a copy is enclosed. These proposed regulations incorporate prior input from Local
Enforcement Agencies, Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs), the AB 1220 Working
Group (a committee of industry, government, and environmental representatives), and
interested parties. </p>

<p>We intend to follow a joint process for our rulemakings. This entails a joint public
hearing on Wednesday, September 11 at 1:00 p.m. at the CIWMB Meeting Room, 8800 Cal Center
Drive, Sacramento, CA 95826. The remainder of the process will be discussed at the
hearing, but most likely will include a joint CIWMB Permitting and Enforcement Committee
Meeting and SWRCB Workshop. Later, CIWMB and SWRCB will hold Board Meetings for adoption
at the same time and place, if feasible. We anticipate adoption in early 1997. </p>

<p>The purpose of the September 11 hearing is to give the public an opportunity to make
oral comments on the Proposed Regulations. Written comments must be received by the end of
the public hearing in order to be considered. Each section has been clearly identified as
to which board is promulgating that section. Therefore, please send comments on the CIWMB
sections to: </p>

<p>Ms. Sharon Anderson Permitting &amp; Enforcement Division, California Integrated Waste
Management Board, 8800 Cal Center Drive, Sacramento, CA 95826. </p>

<p>Please send comments on the SWRCB's sections to: </p>

<p>Ms. Elizabeth L. Haven, Division of Clean Water Programs P.O. Box 944212, Sacramento,
CA 94244-2120. </p>

<p>If you have any questions pertaining to water quality requirements, please contact Mr.
Ed Wosika, Land Disposal Section, SWRCB at (916) 227-4389. Questions pertaining to all
other requirements should be directed to Ms. Anderson, Enforcement Agency Section
Supervisor, CIWMB at (916) 341-6391. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Dorothy Rice, Chief Deputy Director<br />
California Integrated Waste Management Board </p>

<p>Dale Claypoole, Deputy Director<br />
State Water Resources Control Board </p>
