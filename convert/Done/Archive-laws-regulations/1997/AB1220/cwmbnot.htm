<p><b>CHAPTERS 1 - 7.<br />
PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION</b></p>

<p>The California Integrated California Waste Management Board (CIWMB) proposes to amend
Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7, Chapters 3 and 5, Articles as
listed above. The proposed regulations would remove existing overlap, conflict, and
duplication in the regulations between the CIWMB and the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB); and, further, the proposed regulations will minimize overlap and
duplication between the CIWMB and Local Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) regarding the
regulation of solid waste disposal sites. The proposed amendment would also relocate
specified regulations from Title 14, Chapters 3 and 5, to Title 27, Division 2, Chapters 1
through 7, resulting in a consolidated set of regulations promulgated by the CIWMB and
SWRCB for landfills and disposal sites. Regulations being retained in Title 14, Chapters 3
and 5, will be revised as needed to reflect the scope and applicability for solid waste
handling, transfer and processing aspects that will remain in that Title. </p>

<p><b>WRITTEN COMMENT PERIOD</b></p>

<p>Any interested person, or his or her authorized representative, may submit written
comments relevant to the portions of the CIWMB's proposed regulatory action to the CIWMB.
Comments on the SWRCB-promulgated portion of the proposed regulatory action should be
directed to the SWRCB (see accompanying Notice of Proposed Rulemaking - SWRCB). The
written comment period closes at the close of the public hearing to be held on September
11, 1996. The CIWMB will only consider comments received at the CIWMB's headquarters by
that time. Please submit your comments to: </p>

1800-735-2929. </p>

<p><b>INFORMATIVE DIGEST</b></p>

<p>The California Integrated Waste Management Act (Act), Public Resources Code (PRC)
section 40000 et seq., provides for the protection of public health and safety and the
environment through waste prevention, waste diversion, and safe waste processing and
disposal. PRC sections 40502 and 43020 authorize the CIWMB to adopt rules and regulations
for purposes of implementing the Act. Specifically, the Act requires the CIWMB to adopt
and revise regulations which set forth minimum standards for solid waste handling and
disposal. Further, PRC section 43103 requires the CIWMB, in cooperation with the SWRCB, to
revise its regulations as required by the Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act of
1993 (AB 1220/Eastin, Stats. of 1993, c. 656, hereafter referred to AB 1220). </p>

<p>In 1977, pursuant to the State Solid Waste Management Act (the predecessor to the
current Act and AB 1220), the CIWMB adopted regulations setting forth Minimum Standards
for Solid Waste Handling and Disposal and regulations for Enforcement of Solid Waste
Standards and Administration of Solid Waste Facilities Permits; Loan Guarantees. Within
these regulations are the requirements for disposal site operation, permitting, closure
and financial responsibility. The Act required the adoption of regulations specifying
procedures for proper closure and postclosure maintenance including plans and financial
responsibilities. </p>

<p>Under Subtitle D of RCRA, Congress directed the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) to develop regulations governing the management of solid waste, including
regulations for operation, closure and financial responsibility of municipal solid waste
landfills that, in California, are subject to CIWMB regulations promulgated in Title 14,
California Code of Regulations. Congress allows a state to assume responsibility for
regulating municipal solid waste disposal (MSW landfills). California has applied for, and
received, USEPA approval as an approved State to implement the provisions of 40CFR258, the
Federal Rules that USAEPA promulgated under RCRA. The proposed CIWMB action is consistent
with Federal Rules and maintains the requirements necessary to allow continued USEPA
approval of the aspects of California's solid waste program consistent with the authority
granted to the CIWMB under the Act and AB 1220. </p>

<p>The Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act (AB 1220) directs the SWRCB and the
California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)to develop one consolidated set of
solid waste disposal facility regulations including, one consolidated permit application
that requires the operator to develop only one technical report to incorporate the
requirements of both the solid waste facility permit and waste discharge requirements;
and, if possible, the two agencies' financial assurance requirements. AB 1220 further
directs that the CIWMB maintain only its authority to regulate only those aspects of solid
waste disposal that do not involve prevention of water pollution. Furthermore, AB 1220
directs that the promulgation of the combined regulations not result in a decrease in
environmental protection. </p>

<p><b>The Solid Waste Disposal Regulatory Reform Act shapes the development of regulations as
follows: </b> </p>

<p>1) maintain a clear and concise division of authority and responsibility to remove all
areas of overlap, duplication and conflict between the CIWMB and SWRCB in the regulation
of solid waste disposal sites, without reducing current state minimum standards for
environmental protection; </p>

<p>2) consolidate regulations for these sites; </p>

<p>3) streamline the process for obtaining a full solid waste facility permit; and 
clarify and remove overlap in the roles of the local enforcement agency (LEA) 
and CIWMB. </p>

<p>AB 1220 contains many specific provisions that are implemented by the proposed
regulations. AB 1220 requires the CIWMB to effectuate a clear division of authority
between the SWRCB and CIWMB by developing a consolidated set of solid waste disposal
facility regulations where distinct chapters are written and implemented by the
appropriate agency. Further, AB 1220 directed that a clear and concise division of
responsibilities shall be maintained to minimize overlap and duplication between the CIWMB
and the certified local enforcement agencies. The purpose for the separation of authority
is to: </p>

<p>1) make clear that the SWRCB and RWQCBs are the sole agencies regulating the disposal
and classification of solid waste for the purpose of protecting the waters of the state,
and </p>

<p>2) have the CIWMB and LEAs regulate all other aspects of solid waste disposal within
the scope of their appropriate regulatory authority. </p>

<p>The proposed regulations are an attempt to merge all State requirements for solid waste
disposal facilities and sites. Applicable portions of CIWMB regulations contained in Title
14 of the California Code of Regulations, as well as SWRCB regulations contained in
Chapter 15 of Title 23 of the California Code of Regulations, will be moved and
consolidated into Title 27. In addition, Title 27 will contain a single set of definitions
promulgated for use by SWRCB, RWQCBs, CIWMB and LEAs.</p>

<p>The proposed regulations establish a requirement for a joint technical document as
directed by AB 1220. Currently a Report of Disposal Site Information is required as part
of an application to the CIWMB for a solid waste facilities permit while a Report of Waste
Discharge is required by the Regional Water Quality Control Board as part of an
application for Waste Discharge Requirements. These two technical documents contain
significant amounts of information that are similar or identical. The proposed regulation
package would eliminate this duplication by establishing a requirement for a joint
technical document that will be submitted to both agencies.</p>

<p>The proposed regulations will also attempt to eliminate many areas of overlap between
the CIWMB and Local Enforcement Agencies. In general, this will be accomplished by
removing as best as practical the CIWMB from review/approval authority within the
regulations except where this authority is explicitly provided in statute or in applicable
portions of the Code of Federal Regulations. The result will be that the LEA will have
stand-alone authority for approvals and oversight where applicable. Some notable
exceptions to this are the areas of financial assurances, closure plans, Federal Subtitle
D approvals, and solid waste facility permits. For financial assurances, the
responsibility for review and approval will remain with the CIWMB as mandated by existing
statute and not changed by AB 1220. The other major areas where the CIWMB will maintain
its statutory mandates within the regulations are, approval authority for closure plans,
authority for Federal Subtitle D approvals, and concurrence authority for permits.</p>

<p><b>Scope of the rulemaking</b></p>

<p>This rulemaking is initiated to achieve compliance with AB 1220 and is limited to 1)
maintaining applicability to landfills and disposal sites; 2) moving without regulatory
effect, portions of Title 14 that apply to landfills and disposal sites into Title 27; 3)
revising (and moving) existing landfill and disposal site regulations in order to remove
aspects for the protection of water quality and inserting where necessary, applicable
provisions to protect public health and safety and the environment; 4) removing
duplicative roles between the CIWMB and its LEAs where applicable; 5) combining applicable
CIWMB and SWRCB definitions into a consolidated set of definitions; 6) establishing
requirements for a joint application for both the Report of Waste Discharge and Solid
Waste Facility Permit, and streamlining the permitting process; 7) establishing
requirements for a joint technical document; 8) retaining CIWMB authority for those
provisions that are statutorily or federally mandated; 9) combining SWRCB and CIWMB
closure and postclosure maintenance requirements into on set of regulations which require
one closure plan to be prepared for each solid waste landfill; and 10) leaving the
remaining portions of Chapters 3 and 5 of Title 14 unaffected for this rulemaking, yet, at
the same time, revising certain sections of Title 14 to apply to the scope of the
unaffected regulations. </p>

<p><b>PLAIN ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined that it is not feasible to draft the regulations in plain
English due to the technical nature of the regulations; however, a non-controlling, plain
English summary of the regulations is available from the contact person named in this
notice. </p>

<p><b>PLAIN ENGLISH POLICY STATEMENT</b></p>

<p>The proposed regulations would create a clear and concise division of authority and
responsibility--removing all areas of overlap, duplication and conflict--between the CIWMB
and the SWRCB in the regulation of solid waste disposal sites without reducing current
State minimum standards for environmental protection; consolidate regulations for these
sites; and clarify and remove overlap in the roles of the LEAs and the CIWMB. This action
would merge existing CIWMB regulations for disposal sites, contained in Title 14 of the
California Code of Regulations (14 CCR,) with existing SWRCB regulations, for waste
management units, found in 23 CCR, Chapter 15 and move the merged regulations to 27 CCR.</p>

<p><b>AUTHORITY AND REFERENCES</b></p>

<p>PRC sections 40502, 43020, 43030, and 43103 provide authority for these regulations.
The CIWMB proposes to reference PRC sections 43000 through 45042 and the Code of Federal
Regulations, Parts 257 and 258.</p>

<p><b>MANDATES ON LOCAL AGENCIES OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS</b></p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.9, that adoption
of the proposed regulations will not impose a mandate on school districts, nor will they
impose any non-discretionary costs or savings on them. The CIWMB staff has also determined
that the regulations do not place a mandate on local agencies. CIWMB staff has determined
that the regulations do not impose any non-discretionary costs or savings on local
agencies.</p>

<p><b>COST TO PUBLIC AGENCIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS, <br />
AND STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS </b> </p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.5(a)(5) and (6),
that the proposed regulations will result in no costs or savings to any state agencies,
and no costs to any local agencies or school districts that are required to be reimbursed
under Part 7 (commencing with section 17500) of Division 4 of the Government Code, no
other non-discretionary costs or savings on local agencies or school districts, and no
costs or savings in federal funding to the state.</p>

<p><b>EFFECT ON HOUSING COSTS</b></p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.5(a)(11), that the
proposed regulations will have no significant adverse impact on housing costs. </p>

<p><b>EFFECTS ON BUSINESS AND SMALL BUSINESS</b></p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined that the proposed regulations, will have a net zero economic
impact on businesses. The proposed regulations simply reorganize and clarify the authority
of agencies enforcing the existing requirements. The proposed regulations integrate
permitting and approval processes for solid waste disposal sites with applicable
requirements of the SWRCB with no substantive economic impacts. </p>

<p><b>COST IMPACT ON PRIVATE PERSONS OR ENTERPRISES</b></p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code section 11346.2(a)(9), that the
adoption of the proposed regulations will not have a cost impact on private persons or
enterprises. </p>

<p><b>EFFECT ON COMPETITION WITH OUT-OF-STATE BUSINESS</b></p>

<p>CIWMB staff has determined pursuant to Government Code sections 11346.3 and 11346.5,
that the proposed regulations will not have a significant adverse economic impact on
business, including California businesses' ability to compete with out-of-state business.</p>

<p><b>EFFECT ON CREATION OR ELIMINATION OF JOBS, EXISTING OR NEW BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA</b></p>

<p>In accordance with Government Code section 11346.3, CIWMB staff has determined that the
proposed regulatory action will not affect the creation or elimination of jobs within the
State of California, the creation of new businesses or the elimination of existing
businesses within California, or the expansion of businesses currently doing business
within the State. </p>

<p><b>CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES</b></p>

<p>In accordance with Government Code sections 11346.2 and 11346.9, the CIWMB must
determine that no alternative it considers would be more effective in carrying out the
purpose for which the action is proposed or would be as effective and less burdensome to
affected private persons than the proposed action.</p>

<p>The CIWMB invites interested persons to present statements or arguments with respect to
alternatives to the proposed regulations during the written comment period or at the
public hearing.</p>
