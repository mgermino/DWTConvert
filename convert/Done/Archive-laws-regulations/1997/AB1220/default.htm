<p><strong>Description:<br />
</strong>The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) completed a parallel rulemaking as a result of Assembly
Bill 1220 (Chapter 656, Statutes of 1993). Assembly Bill 1220 required clarification of
the roles and responsibilities of the two boards, the Regional Water Quality Control
Boards and the CIWMB's local enforcement agencies in regulating solid waste disposal
sites. The approved Title 27 regulations combine prior disposal site/landfill regulations
of the CIWMB and SWRCB that were maintained in Title 14 CCR and Chapter 15 of Title 23 CCR.</p>

<p><strong>History/Status<br />
</strong>Notice of the proposed change in regulations was published in the <em>California
Regulatory Notice Register</em> on July 26, 1996. The regulations were adopted at a joint
meeting of the CIWMB and SWRCB on January 23, 1997. The Office of Administrative Law
approved the regulations and filed them with the Secretary of State on June 18, 1997 and
they became effective 30 days later, on July 18, 1997.</p>
