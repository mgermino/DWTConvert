<p><strong>Description: &nbsp;</strong>The Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ) Loan
Program provides direct loans to businesses that use post consumer or secondary waste
materials to manufacture new products. To be eligible, the business must be located in a
designated Recycling Market Development Zone. This rulemaking included various amendments
to the existing program regulations in order to clarify, simplify, and improve the
administration of the program and &nbsp;to accelerate the loan application, review, and
approval process. </p>

<p><strong>Affected Regulatory Code Sections: </strong>Title 14, California Code of
Regulations (CCR), Division 7, Chapter 4, Article 1.1, sections 17930 through
17935.6.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Status: &nbsp;</strong>Proposed regulations were adopted on May 28, 1997
&nbsp;and filed with OAL on August 1, 1997. &nbsp;Major portions of the regulations were
approved by OAL on September 15, 1997. The remainder of the proposed
regulations--primarily clarifying language and description of the loan application review
and approval process--were revised and issued for an additional 15-day comment period,
which ends November 4, 1997. Staff anticipates that these revisions will be submitted for
approval at the November 6, 1997 Market Development Committee meeting and at the November
19, 1997 Board Meeting. </p>
