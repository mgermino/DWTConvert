and they became effective on filing with the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><b>Description</b><br />
This rulemaking completed the process initiated with emergency regulations in 1998 to
incorporate new Subtitle D flexibility into state regulation. The flexibilities are:
alternative frequency of application of daily cover and alternative frequency for
explosive gas monitoring for landfills receiving 20 tons or less of waste per day based on
an annual average. </p>
