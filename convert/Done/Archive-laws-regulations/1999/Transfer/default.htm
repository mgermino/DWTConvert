<p>The regulations were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on March 5, 
1999 and became effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Description<br />
</strong>This rulemaking placed material recovery operations and
facilities and transfer stations into regulatory tiers, and developed and amended
corresponding State minimum standards. </p>

<p><strong>Affected Code Sections<br />
</strong>Portions of Title 14, California Code of
Regulations, Division 7, Chapter 3 and Chapter 5</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>The 45-day comment period began January 30, 1998 and ended on
March&nbsp;16, 1998. A public hearing was held on March 19, 1998. An additional 15-day
comment period was noticed from July 1, 1998 until July&nbsp;15, 1998. A public hearing
was held at the Board meeting on August&nbsp;26, 1998.  </p>

<p>A second 15-day comment period
began on September 4, 1998 and ended on September 18, 1998. Following a September 23, 1998
public hearing the Board approved adoption of the regulations and a Memorandum of
Understanding with CAL-OSHA that addressed overlapping standards, training, and 
a referral and response policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The OAL began its 30 working day review on December 22, 1998. On 
February 5, 1999 the OAL disapproved the regulations for minor technical 
reasons. The regulations were then resubmitted and were approved by OAL on March 
5, 1999. The regulations became effective upon approval by OAL.</p>
