    	Workshops were held in October 1999, but the formal rulemaking process 
        was never begun. Board staff is currently awaiting the outcome of a 
        comprehensive program assessment to revise the Used Oil Program 
        regulations. The final report will be presented in the summer of 2003. 
        Existing regulations are in place.<p>
    	<b>Description:</b><br />
        The proposed regulations were intended to streamline the Used
    Oil Recycling Program requirements, provide more clarity to regulated entities and address
    changes in the law. The proposed regulations were changed from a
    &quot;question/answer&quot; to a standard regulation format. Also, many sections 
        would be
    renumbered and numerous editorial and insignificant changes would also be made. The
    proposed regulations will replace the existing regulations after a formal rulemaking
    process.</p>
        <p><b>Affected Regulatory Code Sections: </b><br />
    Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Division 7, sections 18600-18659.5</p>
    <p><b>History</b><br />
    A draft of the proposed changes was posted on the Internet in September 1999. Board staff
    held workshops in October 1999 to outline the changes and receive informal 
    comments. Staff requested Board approval to 
    begin the formal rulemaking process at its
    <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=229&Year=1999&Comm=BRD&Month=12">December 
    14, 1999</a> meeting, but the formal rulemaking process was never begun. 
    Board staff is currently awaiting the outcome of a comprehensive program 
    assessment to revise the Used Oil Program regulations. The final report will 
    be presented in the summer of 2003.</p>
