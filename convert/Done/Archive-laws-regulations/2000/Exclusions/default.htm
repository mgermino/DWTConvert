<b>Description:</b>&nbsp;<br />
    The proposed waste tire storage exclusion regulations (WTSE) will make permanent the
<a href="../1998/TireStor/">emergency regulations</a>
    that were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on June 16, 1998. Those emergency
    regulations removed the indoor storage, &quot;recycling business,&quot; and
    &quot;general&quot; exclusions from Title 14 California Code of Regulations, Section
    18420. <p><b>Affected Code Sections:</b>&nbsp;<br />
    Portions of Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7, Chapter 3&nbsp;and
    Chapter 6.</p>
    <p><b>Status: </b><br />
    Completion of the rulemaking process on the existing emergency regulations was delayed
    while the Board considered the option of adding other changes to tire regulations, based
    on its <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Publications/default.asp?pubid=769">report to the
    Governor and Legislature</a>, as required by AB 117 (Escutia, 1998). At its July 27, 1999
    meeting the Board authorized staff to proceed with the rulemaking process to make the
    emergency regulations permanent. Notice of the 45-day public comment period was published
    in the <em>California Regulatory Notice Register</em> from October 29, 1999 to December
    13, 1999.</p>
    <p>At its December 15, 1999 meeting, the Board adopted the Waste Tire Storage Exclusion
    Regulations and directed staff to submit the regulations to the Office of Administrative
    Law for its review and approval.</p>
