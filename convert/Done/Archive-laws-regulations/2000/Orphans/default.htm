<b>Description:</b><br />
    Solid waste disposal and codisposal site cleanup program revisions. Proposed new
    regulations would cover administration of CIWMB-conducted cleanups, and grants and loans to
    local agencies.<p><b>Affected Code Sections: </b><br />
    Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7, <a href="/Regulations/Title14/Chap10/Art1to3.htm">Chapter 10, Sections 18900-18933</a>.</p>
    <p><b>History:</b><br />
    On March 19, 1998, the Permitting and Enforcement Committee authorized staff to initiate
    the formal rulemaking process. The 45-day comment period for the proposed regulations ran
    from October 9 to November 21, 1998. At the December 15-17,&nbsp;1998 Board meeting in
    Sacramento, the Board directed staff to amend the text of the proposed regulations.</p>
    <p>Staff amended the text but a 15-day public comment period was delayed pending a Board
    discussion of the guiding policy for the solid waste disposal and codisposal site cleanup
    program. The Board adopted a cost recovery policy for the program on June 9, 1999.</p>
    <p>On August 31, 1999 the Board approved the regulations for an additional 15-day comment
    period.&nbsp;The 15-day comment period ran from September 1 to September 15, 1999. The Board adopted the proposed regulations at its <a
    href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=226&amp;Year=1999&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=9">September
    21-22, 1999 meeting</a> in Sacramento.</p>
    <p>The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) began its 30-working-day
    review on October 8, 1999.&nbsp;On November 30, 1999, the OAL delivered notice of its
    disapproval.&nbsp;Board staff revised the regulations in response to OAL's disapproval.</p>
    <p>The Board approved the revised text at its <a
    href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=235&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=1">January
    25, 2000 meeting</a>, and authorized a second 15-day comment period.&nbsp;The second
    15-day comment period ran from January&nbsp;26 to February&nbsp;9, 2000.</p>
    <p>At its <a
    href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=236&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=2">February
    23, 2000 meeting</a> the Board directed staff to initiate a third 15-day comment period.
    The third 15-day comment period ran from February 24 to March 10, 2000.</p>
    <p>At its <a
    href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=238&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=4">April
    18, 2000 meeting</a> the Board directed staff to initiate a fourth 15-day comment period.
    The fourth 15-day comment period ran from April 19 through May 3, 2000.</p>
