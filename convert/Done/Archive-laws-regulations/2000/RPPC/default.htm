This revision was approved by the Office of
      Administrative Law (OAL) in emergency regulations on February 4, 2000. OAL
      made the change permanent on July 11, 2000.
      <p><b>Description</b><br />
      The California Integrated Waste Management
      Board approved the revision of regulations pertaining to the Rigid Plastic
      Packaging Container (RPPC) Program on May 23, 2000. The revision required
      that manufacturers, which are regulated by the RPPC law, retain records to
      document individual compliance for four years following the compliance
      period, rather than two as was originally specified in the regulations.</p>

      Title 14 CCR, Division 7, Chapter 4, Article 3, section 17946.5</a></p>
      <p><b>History<br />
      </b>Emergency regulations were approved by the OAL on February 4, 2000, that
      changed the length of time that manufacturers are required to retain records documenting individual compliance
      from two years following
      the compliance period to four years. A <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=239&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=5"> public hearing</a> was held on May 23-24, 2000 to
      consider making permanent the change made by the emergency regulations. At the
      meeting, the Board approved the permanent regulations and directed staff
      to submit the regulations to OAL for final approval.</p>
      <p>On June 1, 2000, staff submitted the Board-approved regulations to OAL 
      for 30-working-day review.
