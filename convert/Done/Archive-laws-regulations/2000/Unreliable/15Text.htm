authorized by law and shall indicate the basis for such a request.</p>
</u>

<p>(a) The board shall schedule a hearing within 60 days from the appellant&#146;s request
for hearing.</p>

witnesses.</p>

</p>
<strike>

<p>(k) Examples of mitigating factors include without limitation: all of the
appellant&#146;s corporate officers were replaced after the proposed finding of
unreliability was made, or, the appellant pursued criminal action against the party
responsible for the problem that led to the proposed finding of unreliability.</p>

<p>(l)</strike> <u>After considering all presentations and evidence, </u><strike>T</strike><u>the</u>
board shall vote to uphold or overturn the proposed finding of unreliability made by the
Executive Director. A vote to uphold the finding means that the appellant will be added to
the Unreliable List for up to three years from the date of the board meeting. A vote to
overturn the Executive Director&#146;s finding means that the appellant will not be added
to the Unreliable List. In the case of a tie vote, the appellant shall not be added to the
Unreliable List.</p>

requesting that the final finding of unreliability be vacated. This request may be
submitted once only during the three year term of the Unreliable List. The Executive
Director will reconsider the finding of unreliability based on the evidence submitted in
the request. If the Executive Director finds that there is sufficient evidence to deem the
person or entity reliable, they will be removed from the list. If there is not sufficient
evidence to deem the person or entity reliable, then placement on the Unreliable List
remains to the end of the three-year term.</p>
