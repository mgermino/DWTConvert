<p>The Office of Administrative Law approved the regulations on January 7, 2000.</p>

<p><b>Description</b><br />

reliable and can enter into an agreement with the Board. </p>

<p><b>Rulemaking History </b>&nbsp;<br />
A 45-day public comment period was noticed in the January 1, 1999 issue of the <em>California
Regulatory Notice Register</em>.&nbsp; The written comment period closed February 16,
1998.&nbsp; At the March 23-24 meeting, the Board directed staff to make specified changes
to the regulations and notice them for an additional 15-day comment period. Following the
15-day comment period, the Board adopted the regulations on May 27, 1999.&nbsp; The
rulemaking file was submitted to OAL on November 24, 1999 and approved on January 7, 2000.</p>
