The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved these regulations and filed them with the Secretary of State on
      April 12, 2001. The regulations are effective as of May 12, 2001.
      <p><b>Description:</b><br />
    This rulemaking reflects changes in the Public Resources Code brought about with the
    enactment of Statutes, 1995, c. 952 (AB 59, Sher).&nbsp;The regulations provide the CIWMB
    and local enforcement agencies with adequate enforcement tools, consistent with the Public
    Resources Code, which will assist them in ensuring compliance with California and federal
    waste management statutes and regulations while maximizing protection of the public health
    and safety, and the environment.</p>
 <p><b>Affected Regulatory Code Sections:</b><br />
    Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7, sections <a href="/Regulations/Title14/ch5a35.htm#ch5ca4">18304, 18305, 18307,
    18308</a>, and <a href="/Regulations/Title14/ch5a5.htm">18350</a>.</p>
    <p><b>History:</b>&nbsp;<br />
    Informal workshops to solicit comments on the proposed regulations were held in Sacramento
    on August 25, 1998 and in Diamond Bar on August 27, 1998. Informal comments were accepted
    on a revised draft of the regulations that incorporates changes resulting from the two
    August workshops.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>At its June 22, 1999 meeting the Board granted approval to begin a 45-day public
    comment period. A 45-day public comment period ran from March 24, 2000, through May 8,
    2000. The Board held a public hearing during its regularly scheduled meeting on <a
    href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=243&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=9">September
    19-20, 2000</a> where it directed staff to make changes and initiate a 15-day comment
    period.&nbsp; The 15-day comment period ran from September 27 through October 12,
    2000.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The Board adopted the regulations at its <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=244&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=10">October
    17, 2000</a> meeting. On March 1, 2001, Board staff submitted the
      rulemaking file to the OAL for a 30-working-day final review. The
      OAL approved the regulations and filed them with the Secretary of State on
      April 12, 2001.&nbsp; The regulations are effective as of May 12, 2001. </p>
