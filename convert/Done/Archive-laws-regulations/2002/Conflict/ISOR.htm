<p>CHAPTER 5.9. California Integrated Waste Management Board - Conflict of Interest Code
<br />
Section 18419. General Provision<br />
Appendix</p>

<p>PUBLIC PROBLEM, ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENT, OR OTHER CONDITION OR 
CIRCUMSTANCE THE REGULATION IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS.</p>
</b>

<p><b>Background<br />
</b>This regulation implements Government Code sections 87300, 87302, and 87306. Every
governmental agency is required to adopt a conflict of interest code which designates the
positions within the agency which make or participate in the making of decisions which may
foreseeably effect any financial interest. Conflict of interest codes require the
disclosure of those interests which may be affected by any decisions participated in by
the designated positions (Government Code section 87300 and 87302). Conflict of interest
codes must be amended when changes occur necessitating changes in the code (Government
Code section 87306).</p>

<p>The Board's code was last amended in 1993. The code is designated as Chapter 5.9,
Division 7 of Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 18419. The Political
Reform Act requires every state agency to review its Conflict of Interest Code every two
years and submit a notice to the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) that specifies
if the code is accurate, or alternatively, that the code must be amended. The FPPC must
receive this notice from the Board by March 1, 1999. If amendments are necessary, the
revised code must be forwarded to the FPPC for approval within 90 days from the
notification (May 30, 1999, if the notice is filed on March 1, 1999). Changes that would
require an amendment include the addition or deletion of positions subject to the code,
and the addition, deletion, or modification of the types of investments, business
positions, interests in real property, and sources of income which are reportable
(disclosure categories). </p>
        <b>

<p>SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND NECESSITY OF THE REGULATION.</p>
</b>

<p>The proposed revisions do not modify the text of the Board's code which continues to
incorporate the provisions of the Fair Political Practices Commission's Title 2 California
Code of Regulations section 18730. </p>
        <b>

<p>Changes to Designated Positions</p>
</b>

<p>Criteria for determining designated positions</p>

<p>In determining which employees were to be in designated positions for the purposes of
its conflict of interest code, the Board staff followed the requirements of Title 2,
California Code of Regulations, section 18702 et seq. and included all positions which
entailed:</p>

<p>1. The making of decisions, by: 

        <ul>
          <li>voting on matters</li>
          <li>appointing persons </li>
          <li>obligating or committing the Board to any course of action</li>
          <li>entering into contractual agreements on behalf of the Board; or</li>
        </ul>

<p>2. Participation in the making of decisions, other than at a clerical or ministerial
level, by: 

<dir>
  <li>Negotiating, without significant review, with a
        governmental entity or private person on matters regarding decisions,</li>
  <li>Advising or making recommendations to the
        decision-maker by conducting research or an investigation, preparing or presenting a
        report, analysis or opinion which requires the exercise of judgment on the part of the
        designated employee.</li>
</dir>

<p><b>Specific Changes</b></p>

<p>Since the last time that the Conflict of Interest Code was revised in 1993, several
positions have been added to the Board's organizational chart which must be added to the
list of designated positions because they fit within the above criteria. In addition,
several of the Board&#146;s Divisions have changed names, and the Office of Organizational
Effectiveness has been created. Specifically, the following changes are proposed:</p>

<p>Name Changes for Offices and Divisions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Legislation Office is now the Legislative and External Affairs Office</li>
          <li>The Public Affairs and Education Office is now the Office Of Public Affairs</li>
          <li>The Policy and Evaluation Office is now the Policy and Analysis Office</li>
          <li>The Planning and Assistance Division is now the Diversion Planning and Local Assistance
Division</li>
          <li>The Permitting and Compliance Division is now the Permitting and Enforcement Division</li>
          <li>The Research and Technology Development Division is now the Waste Prevention and Market
Development Division</li>
        </ul>

<p>Addition of an Office:</p>

          <li>The Board has added the Office of Organizational Effectiveness</li>

Positions:</p>

        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>deleted due to the sunsetting of authorizing legislation</li>
        </ul>
        <b>

<p>Changes to Disclosure Categories</p>
</b>

<p>Disclosure category assignments for designated positions</p>

<p>Designated positions have been assigned specific disclosure categories based on the
responsibilities of each position. Due to the differences in responsibilities between
divisions, some positions with the same name will have different disclosure categories if
they are in different divisions. For example, a Staff Services Manager in the Legislative
and External Affairs Office must disclose interests in categories 2, 3 and 4, while a
Staff Services Manager in the Permitting and Enforcement Division must disclose interests
in categories 2 through 6. </p>

<p>The disclosure categories were assigned as follows: 

<dir>
  <li>1 through 5: The positions assigned these categories are those which have state-wide
        responsibilities and which are potentially involved with any of the types of issues within
        the board's jurisdiction. For example, Board Members and Division Chiefs must disclose
        interests in these categories.</li>
  <li>2 through 6: The positions assigned these categories are those which are potentially
        involved with any of the types of issues within the board's jurisdiction, but only in
        limited geographic areas. For example, the Permitting and Enforcement Division has a
        Permitting and Inspection Branch that is split between Northern, Central and Southern
        California. Supervising Waste Management Specialists in this branch need not report real
        property interests in an area of the state that they do not have any enforcement
        responsibilities.</li>
  <li>2 through 5: The positions assigned these categories do not have responsibilities which
        have an impact on specific pieces of real property. Therefore, they need not disclose
        their own real property interests. For example, a Waste Management Specialist in the
        Policy and Analysis Office is involved with reports and studies regarding state-wide
        issues and programs on a general scale. This division is not involved with decision-making
        regarding specific projects or facilities.</li>
  <li>2, 3, and 4: The positions assigned these categories do not have responsibilities which
        have an impact on specific pieces of real property as above, they also are not involved
        with specific contracts for goods and services. Therefore, they need not disclose
        interests in companies that contract with the board. For example, a Staff Services Manager
        in the Legislative and External Affairs Office is involved primarily in analyzing,
        proposing and responding to potential legislation.</li>
  <li>4 and 5: The positions assigned these categories have responsibilities that extend only
        to matters involving entities that receive financial or in-kind assistance from the Board
        or who contract with the Board to provide goods and services. For example, most of the
        Administration and Finance Division fits within this category.</li>
</dir>

<p>Specific Changes</p>

<p>The current disclosure categories only reference economic interests in waste industry
operations that the Board has traditionally regulated. However, since 1993, the Board has
adopted regulations that involve &quot;non-traditional&quot; operations and facilities.
Revisions to disclosure categories 2, 3 and 6, have been proposed to broaden the
disclosure categories, without having to list every type of operation or facility. </p>

<p>Similarly, it has become apparent that the Board's activities, regulatory or otherwise,
may impact other industries. Examples of these other industries might include trash bag
manufacturers, newsprint manufacturers, and product manufacturers that use Rigid Plastic
Packaging Containers. Therefore, the proposed amendments to the Conflict of Interest Code
also include language to include these economic interests in disclosure category 3.</p>

<p>Disclosure categories 4 and 6 referenced entities receiving &quot;technical
assistance&quot; from the Board. The proposed revisions would change this language to
&quot;in-kind assistance&quot; to clarify the scope of these categories.</p>

<p>Finally, language has been added to disclosure categories 1 and 6 to clarify the
difference between them.</p>
        <b>

<p>TECHNICAL, THEORETICAL AND/OR EMPIRICAL STUDY, REPORTS, OR DOCUMENTS.</b> 

<ol>
  <li>Political Reform Act and Implementing Regulations</li>
  <li>CIWMB Organizational Chart</li>
</ol>
        <b>

<p>ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN CARRYING
OUT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE ACTION IS PROPOSED OR WOULD BE AS EFFECTIVE AND LESS
BURDENSOME TO AFFECTED PRIVATE PERSONS</p>
</b>

<p>The Board finds that no alternatives it has considered would be more effective in
carrying out the purpose of the proposed regulations or would be as effective and less
burdensome to affected private persons than the proposed regulations. </p>
        <b>

<p>FISCAL IMPACT</p>
</b>

<p>The adoption of the proposed amendment will not impose a cost or savings on any state
agency, local agency or school district that is required to be reimbursed under Part 7
(commencing with section 17500) of Division 4 of the Government Code; will not result in
any nondiscretionary cost or savings to local agencies; will not result in any cost or
savings in federal funding to the state; will not impose a mandate on local agencies or
school districts; and will not have any potential cost impact on private persons or
businesses including small businesses.</p>
