<p><b>TITLE 14. NATURAL RESOURCES<br />
DIVISION 7. CALIFORNIA INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT BOARD<br />
CHAPTER 5.9, SECTION 18419 CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE</b></p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION</h2>

<p>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) proposes to amend Title 14,
California Code of Regulations, Division 7, Chapter 5.9, section 18419. The proposed
regulations make revisions to the Board's Conflict of Interest Code by adding designated
positions and clarifying the disclosure categories.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">WRITTEN COMMENT PERIOD</h2>

<p>Any interested person, or his or her authorized representative, may submit written
comments relevant to the proposed regulatory action to the Board. The written comment
period closes at 5:00 p.m. on May 3, 1999. The Board will only consider comments
received at the Board&#146;s headquarters by that time. Please submit your written
comments to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p ALIGN="left">Elliot Block<br />
Legal Office<br />
California Integrated Waste Management Board<br />
8800 Cal Center Drive<br />
Sacramento, California 95826</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 ALIGN="left">PUBLIC HEARING</h2>

<p>A public hearing has not been scheduled. However, any interested person or his or her
duly authorized representative may request, no later than 15 days prior to the close of
the written comment period, a public hearing pursuant to Government Code §11346.8. Please
address all requests to the Board&#146;s contact person as designated in this Notice.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">INFORMATIVE DIGEST</h2>

<p>This regulation implements Government Code sections 87300, 87302, and 87306. Every
governmental agency is required to adopt a conflict of interest code which designates the
positions within the agency which make or participate in the making of decisions which may
foreseeably effect any financial interest. Conflict of interest codes require the
disclosure of those interests which may be affected by any decisions participated in by
the designated positions (Government Code section 87300 and 87302). Conflict of interest
codes must be amended when changes occur necessitating changes in the code (Government
Code section 87306).</p>

<p>Title 14 California Code of Regulations section 18419, which contains the Board's
Conflict of Interest Code, is proposed to be amended as follows:</p>

<h3>Changes to Designated Positions</h3>

<p>Since the last time that the Conflict of Interest Code was revised in 1993, several
positions have been added to the Board's organizational chart which must be added to the
list of designated positions. In addition, several of the Board&#146;s Divisions have
changed names, and the Office of Organizational Effectiveness has been created.</p>

<h3>Changes to Disclosure Categories</h3>

<p>The current disclosure categories only reference economic interests in waste industry
operations that the Board has traditionally regulated. However, since 1993, the Board has
adopted regulations that involve &quot;non-traditional&quot; operations and facilities.
Revisions to the disclosure categories have been proposed to broaden the disclosure
categories, without having to list every type of operation or facility. </p>

<p>Similarly, it has become apparent that the Board's activities, regulatory or otherwise,
may impact other industries. Examples of these other industries might include trash bag
manufacturers, newsprint manufacturers, and product manufacturers that use Rigid Plastic
Packaging Containers. Therefore, the proposed amendments to the Conflict of Interest Code
also include language to include these economic interests in the disclosure categories.</p>

<p>Finally, two of the categories referenced entities receiving &quot;technical
assistance&quot; from the Board. The proposed revisions would change this language to
&quot;in-kind assistance&quot; to clarify the scope of these categories.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">FISCAL IMPACT </h2>

<p><b>Fiscal Impact on Local Government.</b> This regulation will have no fiscal impact on
any local entity or program.</p>

<p><b>Fiscal Impact on State Government.</b> This regulation will have no fiscal impact on
any state agency or program.</p>

<p><b>Fiscal Impact on Federal Funding of State Programs.</b> No fiscal impact exists because
this proposed regulation does not effect the federal funding of any state program or
agency.</p>

<p>The adoption of the proposed amendment will not impose a cost or savings on any state
agency, local agency or school district that is required to be reimbursed under Part 7
(commencing with section 17500) of Division 4 of the Government Code; will not result in
any nondiscretionary cost or savings to local agencies; will not result in any cost or
savings in federal funding to the state; will not impose a mandate on local agencies or
school districts; and will not have any potential cost impact on private persons or
businesses including small businesses.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">AUTHORITY AND REFERENCE </h2>

<p><b>Authority:</b> Government Code section 87306</p>

<p><b>Reference:</b> The purpose of these regulations is to implement, interpret and make
specific Government Code sections 87300 - 87302, and 87306.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES</h2>

<p>The Board must determine that no other alternatives considered by the agency would be
more effective in carrying out the purpose for which the action is proposed or would be as
effective and less burdensome to affected private persons than the proposed action.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">CONTACT PERSON</h2>

<p>Inquiries concerning the substance of the proposed action may be directed to:</p>

<blockquote>

California Integrated Waste Management Board<br />

</blockquote>

<h2 ALIGN="left">AVAILABILITY OF STATEMENT OF REASONS AND TEXT OF PROPOSED REGULATIONS 
</h2>

<p>The Board will have the entire rulemaking file, and all information upon which the
proposed regulations are based, available for inspection and copying throughout the
rulemaking process at the above address. As of the date this notice is published in the
Notice Register, the rulemaking file consists of this notice, the proposed text of the
regulations, the initial statement of reasons, and the Board's most recent organizational
chart . Copies may be obtained by contacting Elliot Block at the address or phone number
listed above. </p>

<h2 ALIGN="left">AVAILABILITY OF CHANGED OR MODIFIED TEXT</h2>

<p>The Board may adopt the proposed regulations substantially as described in this notice.
If the Board makes modifications which are sufficiently related to the originally proposed
text, it will make the modified text -- with changes clearly indicated -- available to the
public for at least 15 days before the Board adopts the regulations as revised. Requests
for the modified test should be made to the contact person named. The Board will mail any
modified text to all persons who testify at the public hearing; all persons who submit
written comments at the public hearing; all persons whose comments are received during the
comment period; and all persons who request notification of the availability of such
changes. The Board will accept written comments on the modified regulations for 15 days
after the date on which they are made available. </p>
