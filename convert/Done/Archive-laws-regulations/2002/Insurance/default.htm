        The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved
      the regulations and filed them with the Secretary of State on May 9,
      2002. The regulations are effective on June 8, 2002.<p><b>Description<br />
        </b>This rulemaking proposes regulatory amendments to two related financial assurance
    demonstration requirements under the general term of &quot;insurance.&quot; The first clarifies that insurance demonstrations
      from captive insurers are considered under the same requirements and
      standards as insurance coverage provided by any other insurer. The
      second is a proposed amendment to the Board's current Certificate of Insurance for
    Closure, Postclosure Maintenance, and Reasonably Foreseeable Corrective Action (CIWMB
    106). The second proposed amendment clarifies to the provider of insurance (insurer)
    that when the Board makes a claim against the insurance coverage, the insurer is liable
    for full payment, without delay.<b></p>
