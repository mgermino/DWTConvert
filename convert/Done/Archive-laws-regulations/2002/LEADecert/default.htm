      <p><b>History <br />
      </b>The Permitting and Enforcement Committee approved these draft

    the Permitting and Enforcement Committee action the Board did not initiate a public
    comment period.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Board discussed updated regulations at its
      <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=268&Year=2001&Comm=BRD&Month=3">March
    20-21, 2001, meeting</a>.&nbsp;The Board approved the regulations for a 45-day public comment
      period at its
      <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=270&Year=2001&Comm=BRD&Month=4">April
      24-25, 2001 meeting</a>. A 45-day public comment period ran from October 12, 2001 through
      November 27, 2001.</p>
      <p>The Board held a public hearing and adopted the regulations on <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=345&amp;Year=2002&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=1">January
      23, 2002</a>. On June 14, 2002, staff submitted the rulemaking file to the Office of Administrative
      Law for a 30-working-day review. OAL approved the regulations on July 25,
