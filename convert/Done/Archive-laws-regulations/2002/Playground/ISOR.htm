<h4>Chapter 7.2. Natural Resources<br />
Article 1. General<br />
Section 18570. Scope</h4>
<p>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The purpose of the proposed regulation is to provide guidance to Board     
staff, and grant applicants, in the administration of the Grant Program     
established under the Playground Safety and Recycling Act (Act). The proposed     
regulation supports the development of markets for recycled materials suitable     
for use in public playgrounds. The proposed regulation cites the authority of     
the Board to adopt regulations for the implementation of the Program.</p>    
<p><b>Technical, Theoretical, and/or Empirical Study, Report, or Document the 
Agency Relied Upon in Proposing the Regulation</b><br />
Throughout this Initial Statement of Reasons, the following response shall be 
used as a response to the requirement that the above findings be made for each 
proposed regulatory action:</p>
<p>The Board did not rely upon technical, theoretical and/or empirical studies, 
reports, or documents for this regulatory action.</p>
<b>
<p>Alternatives to the Proposed Regulatory Action That Would Be as Effective and 
Less Burdensome to Private Persons, and Alternatives to the Proposed Regulatory 
Action That Would Lessen Adverse Economic Impact on Small Business.<br />
</b>Throughout this Initial Statement of Reasons, the following response shall     
be used as a response to the requirement that the above findings be made for     
each proposed regulatory action:</p>    
<p>The Board considered adopting the proposed regulations as internal management 
procedures; however, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 115814, the 
Board determined that regulations were necessary to implement the Grant Program. 
The Board determined that: 1) no other alternative would be as effective and 
less burdensome to private persons while at the same time protecting human 
health, safety, and the environment; and 2) no other alternative would lessen 
adverse economic impact on small business while protecting human health, safety 
and the environment.</p>
<p><b>Evidence That Supports a Finding That the Action Will Not Have a 
Significant Adverse Economic Impact on Business.</b><br />
Throughout this Initial Statement of Reasons, the following response shall be 
used as a response to the requirement that the above findings be made for each 
proposed regulatory action:</p>
<p>A completed Economic and Fiscal Impact Statement, approved by the California 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Finance, was submitted 
with the Emergency Rulemaking File. The completed Economic and Fiscal Impact 
Statement showed no private sector cost impact since the regulations set forth 
administrative procedures for the Board and applicants to follow for a voluntary 
grant program which is limited solely to local public, and local public 
educational, agencies.</p>
<p><b>Efforts Undertaken to Avoid Duplication or Conflict With Federal 
Regulations</b><br />
The Grant Program is a voluntary California grant program limited to local 
public, and local public educational, agencies within the state and is funded by 
appropriations made by the state legislature. The program is intended to assist 
this class of California playground operators in upgrading, repairing, 
refurbishing, installing, or replacing public playground equipment in order to 
meet State safety regulations for playgrounds. The State safety regulations for 
playgrounds, adopted by the Department of Health Services, incorporate by 
reference the playground safety guidelines outlined in the <i>Handbook for 
Public Playground Safety</i> as published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission and ASTM F 1487-98, <i>Standard Consumer Safety Performance 
Specification for Playground Equipment for Public Use</i>, as published by the 
American Society for Testing and Materials in the <i>Annual Book of ASTM 
Standards</i>. Therefore, throughout this Initial Statement of Reasons, the 
following response shall be used as a response to the requirement that the above 
findings be made for each proposed regulatory action:</p>
<p>There is no known duplication or conflict of this regulation with Federal 
Regulations. There is no federal regulation that applies to state contracts, 
subcontracts, grants and loans. The proposed regulations therefore do not 
duplicate any federal regulations. Government Code Section 11346.2(b)(6).</p>
<b>
<h4>Article 2. Definitions<br />
Section 18571. Definitions of Key Terms</h4>
<p>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<u><br />
</u></b>The inclusion of standardized definitions of words and terms used in the     
proposed regulation will serve to ensure that the regulations are evenly and     
consistently applied to the regulated community. The purpose of this section is     
to define or clarify terms not sufficiently defined in the Act or existing     
regulations. Defining terms to be used in the administration of the Grant     
Program will guide the uniform application of program requirements and ensure     
the dissemination of consistent information for use by Board staff, grant     
applicants, and the public.</p>    
<b>
<h4>Article 3. Eligible Local Public Agencies and Eligible Projects<br />
Section 18572. Eligible Local Public, and Public Educational, Agencies</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>In order to establish the eligibility of public agencies under the Act, the 
proposed regulation outlines two requirements of applicants. First, the 
applicant must operate a playground that is open to the public. Second, the 
applicant must demonstrate its ability to provide matching funds, either through 
public or private sources or from in-kind contributions. Matching funds must 
equal fifty percent (50%) of the requested grant amount. If the Board finds that 
the matching requirement would impose an extreme financial hardship (as 
defined), matching funds may be reduced to twenty-five percent (25%) of the 
requested grant amount.</p>
<p>The proposed regulation provides for the submission of a duly authorized 
joint venture application which designates the lead agency.</p>
<p>The proposed regulations provide notice that funding authority may limit 
eligible applicants to local public educational agencies.</p>
<h4><b>Section 18573. Eligible Projects</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>In order for a project to be eligible under the Act, the proposed regulation 
sets forth three requirements. First, the project applicant must operate a 
public playground that has been inspected by a Certified Playground Safety 
Inspector prior to submission of the grant application. Second, the project must 
describe the need to upgrade, repair, refurbish, install, or replace the 
playground facility including any play equipment, surfacing, fencing, signs, 
internal pathways, internal landforms, vegetation, and related structures. Last, 
fifty percent (50%) of the grant funds awarded for the project must be expended 
on recycled-content equipment and/or materials.</p>
<b>
<h4>Article 4. Criteria,<u> </u>Selection Process, and Required Documentation<br />
Section 18574. Criteria</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation sets forth criteria established by the Board for the 
evaluation of grant applications. Since all grant applicants must provide 
information on the same criteria the regulation will provide a uniform tool for 
the Board to use in the review, scoring, and ranking of competitive 
applications. The criteria upon which all applicants will be evaluated and 
ranked include: need, objectives of the project, methodology/work statement, 
method to evaluate the success of the project, budget, completeness, and 
resource conservation.</p>
<b>
<h4>Section 18575. Selection Process</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation provides for a method of determining which 
successful applicants receive funding. All applications will be ranked according 
to the total points received. In the event there are more qualified applicants 
than funding, a random number selection process may be used. All successful 
applicants may be placed into a common pool and a random number generator may be 
utilized to draw candidates from that pool. Candidates will be awarded funds in 
the order selected until all available funds are encumbered. Any remaining funds 
not awarded will be disencumbered.</p>
<b>
<h4>Section 18575.1 Required Documentation</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation establishes a uniform method for all grant 
applicants to follow when submitting date-sensitive documentation to the Board. 
Board staff, having previously received several types of required documentation 
through the logistics and security at the Board’s CalEPA headquarters 
location, has determined that the most effective and secure delivery methods are 
by commercial delivery services or the U.S. Mail. The use of commercial delivery 
services or the U.S. Mail will ensure that all such required documentation is 
marked with the date that it was accepted by the carrier for delivery to the 
Board. The use of these services further ensures that the documentation is 
received in a secure central location at the CalEPA headquarters building thus 
reducing the likelihood of misdelivery or loss of these important materials. Any 
general communications which are non date-sensitive may continue to be made to 
the Board via telephone or fax, by letter, or by e-mail, as appropriate.</p>
<b>
<h4>Article 5. Grant Amount and Eligible Costs<br />
Section 18576. Apportionment of Funds</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation sets the apportionment of available funds for 
successful applicants. After adoption of the Emergency Regulations the Board 
considered administrative methods for allocating funds to successful applicants 
in order to ensure a fair distribution of the grant moneys among the various 
population groupings of the State. Taking into account the distribution of the 
state’s population between northern and southern California, the Board 
determined that a fair apportionment of available funds is based on population 
data provided by the Department of Finance. The Board will direct adjustments to 
this apportionment as updated population information becomes available.</p>
<b>
<h4>Section 18577</b>. <b>Grant Amount</h4>    
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation informs that the amount of funds available for each 
grant award are set by the law and may not exceed that amount.</p>
<b>
<h4>Section 18578. Eligible costs</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation describes the specific activities of a grant project 
that are eligible for funding. These activities include those which are 
described in the grantee’s approved grant agreement and budget itemization, 
those which occur after the grantee receives a Notice to Proceed, those which 
occur during the grant term, and those that relate directly to the 
implementation of the approved grant project.</p>
<b>
<h4>Section 18579. Ineligible costs</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation provides guidance to all parties by listing specific 
costs that are not eligible for reimbursement..</p>
<b>
<h4>Section 18580. Payments</h4>
</b>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation.<br />
</b>The proposed regulation places a condition on the method of payment to 
grantees under the program. The regulation requires that payments be made in 
arrears on a cost-reimbursement basis in order to ensure that payments are for 
work conducted on the project as approved. An additional condition is for the 
Board to withhold ten percent (10%) from the total of each approved grant 
payment amount. Any withheld and final grant amounts are payable to the grantee 
when all the requirements of the grant agreement have been satisfied and the 
final request for payment is approved.</p>
