<p><b>Title 14 Natural Resources<br /> 
Division 7 California Integrated Waste Management Board<br /> 
Chapter 7.2 Playground Safety and Recycling Act Grant Program</b></p> 
<p><b><a name="Proposed">Proposed</a> Regulatory Action</b><br /> 
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board) proposes to adopt  
Emergency Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Division 7, Chapter 7.2,  
Sections 18570 through 18580 as amended, as the final rule. The proposed final  
regulations establish the procedures for the Board to follow in the  
administration of grants awarded to local public agencies and local public  
educational agencies to upgrade, repair, refurbish, install, or replace public  
playground facilities to prevent childhood injuries on public playgrounds while  
developing a market for recycled materials suitable for use in public  
playgrounds.</p>
<p><b><a name="Comment">Written Comment</a> Period</b><br /> 
Any interested person, or his or her authorized representative, may submit  
written comments relevant to the proposed regulatory action to the Board. The  
written comment period closes on August 8, 2001 and the Board will only consider  
comments received at the Board’s headquarters by that time. Comments may be  
mailed to:</p> 
<blockquote>
  <p>Proposed Regulations<br />
  Playground Safety and Recycling Act Grant Program<br />
  1001 I Street, MS-22<br />
  P.O. Box 4025<br />
  Sacramento, CA 95812-4025</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or e-mailed.</p>
<p><b><a name="Hearing">Public Hearing</a></b><br /> 
A public hearing has not been scheduled. However, any interested person or his    
or her duly authorized representative may request, no later than 15 days prior    
to the close of the written comment period, a public hearing pursuant to    
Government Code §11346.8. Please address all requests to the Board’s contact    
person as designated in this Notice.</p>   
<p><b><a name="Digest">Informative Digest</a><br /> 
</b>The California Integrated Waste Management Act (IWM Act), Public Resources  
Code (PRC) Sections 40000 et seq., gives the Board authority to provide for the  
protection of public health, safety, and the environment through waste  
prevention, waste diversion, and safe waste processing and disposal. The Public  
Contract Code (PCC), Sections 12200 et seq., requires all local and state public  
agencies to purchase recycled products whenever available at no more than the  
total cost of nonrecycled products. It also requires vendors to specify the  
percentage of recycled material in the products offered. The PCC also indicates  
that it is the intent of the Legislature that the state pursues all feasible  
measures to improve markets for recycled products.</p> 
<p>The Playground Safety and Recycling Act (H&amp;S Code), Sections 115810 et 
seq., gives the Board authority to provide for the protection of the public 
health, safety, and the environment through administration of a grant program 
for local public agencies and local public educational agencies which will 
assist them to upgrade, repair, refurbish, install, or replace public playground 
facilities to prevent childhood injuries on public playgrounds while developing 
a market for recycled materials suitable for use in public playgrounds.</p>
<p>The H&amp;S Code Section 115814 gives the Board the authority to adopt 
emergency regulations to develop and administer a program to provide grants to 
local agencies to upgrade, repair, refurbish, install, or replace public 
playground facilities and promote the use of recycled materials in those 
playground facilities.</p>
<p>The proposed final regulations define the scope of the Board’s authority to 
administer the grants program and provide clear guidelines for potential 
grantees entering into Board agreements. The proposed final regulations will 
address these issues by establishing the procedures by which the Board will 
administer the grants under this program.</p>
<p><b><a name="PERequirements">Plain English Requirements</a></b><br /> 
The proposed final regulations must satisfy the standard of clarity provided in  
Section 11349 of the Administrative Procedures Act. This standard requires that  
the regulations be written or displayed so that their meaning will be easily  
understood by those persons directly affected by them. The proposed final  
regulations are considered non-technical and were written to be easily  
understood by those parties which will use them. They are administrative in  
nature and apply to the Board’s internal management of a voluntary grant  
program for upgrading playgrounds to meet new safety standards and to improve  
markets for recycled content materials used in those playgrounds. They provide  
clear program guidance to Board staff and affected grant applicants.</p> 
<p><b><a name="PEPolicy">Plain English Policy Statement</a></b><br /> 
The proposed regulations provide guidance for the Board’s administration of  
the grants program established under the Playground Safety and Recycling Act.  
They provide controlling guidance to Board staff and grant applicants through  
the definition of key terms used in the chapter. They set forth the criteria for  
the eligibility of local public and local public educational agencies and for  
the eligibility of grant projects. They set forth the criteria established by  
the Board for the evaluation of applications and they set the selection process  
to be used. They set requirements for the submission of required documentation.  
The regulations also provide guidance and clarity on how grant funds will be  
apportioned among applicants from northern and southern California counties. The  
regulations also describe grant amounts, detail eligible and ineligible project  
costs, and describe how the Board will conduct the payment procedure.</p> 
<p><b><a name="References">Authority and References</a></b><br /> 
H&amp;S Code Section 115814 provides authority for these regulations. The  
purpose of the proposed action is to implement, and make permanent the adopted  
Emergency Regulations as amended.</p> 
<p>Definitions: PRC §42002 - Postconsumer waste material, Secondary waste    
material. PCC §12200 - Recycled product, Postconsumer material, Secondary    
material. H&amp;S Code §115735 - Playground. H&amp;S Code §115812 - Board,    
Playground</p>

<p><b><a name="Mandate">Local Mandate</a> and Fiscal Determinations</b><br /> 
Board staff has determined that the proposed regulations do not impose: (1) a  
mandate on local public agencies or school districts; (2) significant costs or  
savings to any state agency; (3) costs to any local agency or school district  
that must be reimbursed in accordance with Government Code 17500 through 17630;  
(4) other nondiscretionary costs or saving on local agencies; or (5) costs or  
savings in federal funding to the state.</p> 
<p><b><a name="Housing">Effect on Housing Costs</a></b><br /> 
Board staff has determined that the proposed regulations will not have a  
significant adverse impact on housing costs.</p> 
<p><b>Effect on Business and Small Businesses/Small Business Determination<br />
</b>Board staff has determined that the proposed regulations will not apply to 
business and small businesses and will not have a significant adverse economic 
impact on business and small businesses. Any person or entity who applies for a 
Board agreement under these regulations must complete an application form. Only 
local public agencies or local public school agencies are eligible to apply 
under these regulations.</p>
<p><b>Effect on Competition With Out-of-State Business</b><br />
Board staff has determined that the proposed regulations will not have an 
adverse economic impact upon the ability of California businesses to compete 
with out-of-state businesses.</p>
<p><b>Effect on Creation or Elimination of Jobs, Existing or New Business in the 
State of California</b><br />
Board staff has determined that the proposed regulatory action will not affect: 
(1) the creation or elimination of jobs within the State of California; (2) the 
creation of new businesses or the elimination of existing businesses within 
California; or (3) the expansion of businesses currently doing business with the 
state.</p>
<p><b>Cost Impact on Private Persons or Enterprises<br />
</b>Board staff has determined that the adoption of the proposed regulations 
will not have a cost impact on private persons or enterprises. Any impacts of 
the proposed regulations already exist in current law. The proposed regulations 
clarify existing law and impose no new impacts.</p>
<p><b>Consideration of Alternatives</b><br />
The Board must determine whether other alternatives would be more effective in 
carrying out the purpose for which the action is proposed or would be as 
effective and less burdensome to affected private persons than the proposed 
action.</p>
<p>The Board invites interested persons to present statements or arguments with 
respect to alternatives to the proposed regulations during the written comment 
period.</p>
<p><b>Availability of Statement of Reasons and Text of Proposed Regulations</b><br />
The Board will have the entire rulemaking file, and all information upon which

the address, e-mail, or phone number listed above. For more timely access to the 
proposed text of the regulations, and in the interest of waste prevention, 
interested parties are encouraged to access the Board’s Web site.</p>
<p><b>Availability of Changed or Modified Text</b><br />
The Board may adopt the proposed regulations substantially as described in this 
notice. If the Board makes modifications which are sufficiently unrelated to the 
proposed text, it will make the modified text--with changes clearly indicated--available 
to the public for at least 15 days before the Board adopts the regulations as

public hearing; all persons whose comments are received during the comment 
period; and all persons who request notification of the availability of such 
changes. The Board will accept written comments on the modified regulations for
