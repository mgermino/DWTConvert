    	The final rule was not filed with the Secretary of State. As funding has been 
        expended, the program no longer exists, and the regulations are no 
        longer needed. The package was formally withdrawn on September 5, 2002.<p><b>Description</b><br />
      This rulemaking will make permanent the emergency regulations the Board
      adopted at its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=238&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=4">regular
      meeting on April 18-19, 2000</a>. The emergency regulations established
      the Board�s administrative procedures to implement the awarding of
      grants under the authority of the Playground Safety and Recycling Act (AB
      1055). Grants under the act may be awarded to specified local public
      agencies to upgrade, repair, refurbish, install, or replace, public
      playground facilities in order to reduce and prevent injuries to children
      while at the same time developing markets for equipment made from recycled
      materials suitable for use in public playgrounds.</p>
      <p><b>Affected Regulatory Code Sections</b><br />
      Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 7,
      Chapter 7.2, sections 18570, 18571, 18572, 18573, 18574, 18575, 18576,
      18577, 18578, 18579, and 18580.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Note: The numbering of the CCR sections as approved by the Board ran
      consecutively from 18540-18550. The numbering was changed by the Office of
      Administrative Law (OAL) to those noted above.</p>
      <b>
      <p>History<br />
      </b>Emergency regulations were adopted by the Board on April 18-19, 2000
      and forwarded to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL).</p>
      <p>At its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=270&amp;Year=2001&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=4">April
      24-25, 2001 meeting</a> the Board approved the proposed permanent
      regulations to be noticed for a 45-day public comment period. As directed
      by the Board, staff prepared minor changes to the proposed regulations and
      an <a href="ISOR.htm"> Initial Statement of Reasons</a> preparatory to initiating
      the required 45-day public comment period.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>OAL published the proposed regulations in the California Regulatory
      Notice Register on June 29, 2001, initiating the 45-day public comment
      period. The final day to receive public comment was August 13, 2001. Based
      on comments received, no amendments to the proposed regulations were
      deemed necessary by Board staff.</p>
      <p>The Board adopted the regulations at its regularly scheduled <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=278&amp;Year=2001&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=8">meeting
      on August 14-15, 2001</a>. Upon completion of legal review of the closed
      rulemaking record the regulations were forwarded to the Office of
      Administrative Law for filing with the Secretary of State and for
      publication in the California Code of Regulations.</p>
      <p>The final rule was not filed with the Secretary of State. As funding has been 
        expended, the program no longer exists, and the regulations are no 
        longer needed. The package was formally withdrawn on September 5, 2002.</p>
