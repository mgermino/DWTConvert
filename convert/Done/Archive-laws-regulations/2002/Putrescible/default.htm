      Article 6.0</a></p>
      <p><b>Rulemaking History</b><br />
    At its <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=264&amp;Year=2001&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=1"> January 24,
      2001 meeting</a> the Board directed staff to initiate an
    emergency rulemaking process to clarify that the Board's current standards
    for transfer/processing operations and facilities apply to the
    transfer/processing of putrescible wastes.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p> The Board adopted emergency regulations at its
      <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=266&amp;Year=2001&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=2">February
      20-22 meeting</a>. Following this action, the Board received feedback from
      parties concerned about the potential impacts of the emergency
      regulations.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p> In response to the feedback received staff brought the regulations back to the Board for
      re-evaluation at its <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=270&amp;Year=2001&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=4">April
      24-25, 2001 meeting</a>, the Board directed staff to make changes to
      the regulations and then submit to the Office of Administrative Law with a request for a delayed effective date (length to be determined) as
      an emergency rulemaking.
      </p>
      <p> Board staff conducted <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/leamemo/2001/PutresWksp.htm">
      informal public workshops</a> for the purpose of soliciting feedback on
      proposed regulations on July 16 and 17, 2001. These workshops initiated the
      regular rulemaking process for making the regulations permanent.
      </p>
      <p> The Office of Administrative Law approved the emergency regulations,
      including a 180-day delayed effective date, and filed them with the Secretary
      of State on August 13, 2001. The emergency regulations are effective as of
      February 13, 2002.

      public comment period for the proposed permanent regulations (August 2001
