<h4>November 30, 2001</h4>

<b>
<p>Title 14. Natural Resources<br />   
Division 7. Solid Waste<br />  
Chapter 4. Resource Conservation Programs<br /> 
Article 3. Regulations for the Rigid Plastic Packaging Container Program<br /> 
Section 17943. Purpose and Definitions</p> 
</b>
<p><b>Public Problem, Administrative Requirement, or Other Condition or 
Circumstance the Regulation is Intended to Address</b><br />
The Rigid Plastic Packaging Container (RPPC) Act of 1991 (SB 235, Hart, Chapter 
769) was passed by the Legislature, was approved by the Governor on October 9, 
1991, and took effect as Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 42300 et seq. on 
January 1, 1992. During 1993, Emergency Regulations were adopted by CIWMB, as 
required by PRC section 42325, and became effective on January 1, 1994.</p>
<p>The law requires every RPPC offered for sale in California to meet, on 
average, one of six compliance criteria. These criteria were designed to 
encourage reuse and recycling of RPPCs, the use of more postconsumer resin in 
RPPCs and a reduction in the amount of virgin resin employed RPPCs. RPPCs must 
meet one of three design criteria or be recycled at one of three specified 
rates. The CIWMB is required to calculate two of these rates annually; the 
statewide RPPC all-container rate, which is an aggregate recycling rate for all 
RPPCs, and the statewide recycling rate for polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) 
RPPCs. The all-container recycling rate accounts for a variety of containers 
holding products such as laundry detergents, motor oil, food, cosmetics, and 
soft drinks. The other recycling rate includes primarily beverage and drink 
containers made from PETE. The statutory minimum rate for the all-container rate 
is 25%, and is 55% for PETE. If either of these recycling rates fall below the 
statutory minimum, CIWMB may require manufacturers to certify that they were in 
compliance with one of the other options during that year.</p>
<p>The current regulations do not explicitly state how the CIWMB must calculate 
its recycling rates and do not expressly mention using the previous year’s 
rates for compliance purposes. Further, the CIWMB’s past practice has not 
included the use of previous year’s rates. This practice does not give 
regulated product manufacturers sufficient notice in order to comply with the 
RPPC law by using one of the other compliance options, and has resulted in a 
significant number of manufacturers being out of compliance and therefore 
subject to public hearing and possible fines. To provide adequate notice, the 
Board directed staff to initiate emergency regulations to use the actual 
recycling rate from the previous year to determine compliance in the current 
year.</p>
<p>If the regulatory change is not made, the Board will be unable to give 
advance notice to regulated product manufactures, which would allow them to take 
appropriate actions to ensure compliance with the RPPC law for the 2001 and 
future compliance years. If the regulatory change is made, the Board will be 
able to advise manufacturers in a timely manner which will put manufacturers on 
notice of their responsibility to comply with the law and should result in a 
significantly higher percentage of the regulated community being in compliance, 
and carry out the law as the Legislature intended.</p>
<p><b>Specific Purpose and Necessity of the Regulation<br />
</b>The purpose of the regulatory modification is to provide regulated product 
manufacturers with adequate notice to ensure their ability to comply with the 
RPPC law.</p>
<p><b>Technical, Theoretical, and/or Empirical Study, Reports, or Documents&nbsp;<br />
</b>The CIWMB relied upon the following in proposing the adoption of this   
regulation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Rigid Plastic Packaging Container Act of 1991</li>
  <li>Written materials and comments received by the CIWMB leading up to and 
    during <a href="../../2001/RPPCRates/">development of the Emergency 
    Regulations</a> for amending Section 17943.</li>
</ul>
<p>All written material relied upon will be made available for inspection and 
copy throughout this rulemaking process.</p>
<b>
<p>Alternatives to the Proposed Regulatory Action That Would Be as Effective and    
Less Burdensome to Private Persons, and Alternatives to the Proposed Regulatory    
Action That Would Lessen Adverse Economic Impact on Small Business.&nbsp;<br />  
</b>Alternatives to the proposed regulations have been considered, including a   
&quot;no action&quot; alternative. CIWMB staff have determined that: (1) no   
alternative would be as effective and less burdensome to private persons while   
at the same time fulfilling the requirements of the statute; and (2) no   
alternative would lessen any adverse economic impact on small business.</p>  
<p>This regulation amendment will not have a significant adverse economic impact 
on business, or on the ability of California business to compete with businesses 
in other states.</p>
<p>CIWMB staff has determined that the proposed regulatory amendment does not 
pose a significant cost and/or savings to result in the creation or elimination 
of jobs, occupations, or businesses in California.</p>
