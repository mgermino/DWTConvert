<h4>Proposed Regulatory Action</h4>
<p></b>The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)proposes to 
amend Title 14, California Code of Regulations Division 7, Chapter 4, Article 3 
by modifying section 17943. Emergency regulations were filed with the Secretary 
of State on September 17, 2001. The amended regulation changes the year the 
recycling rate is used for determining compliance with section 17944 (A) or (B) 
by using the actual recycling rate from the previous year to determine 
compliance in the current year.</p>
<h4><b>Written Comment Period</b></h4>
<p>Any interested person, or that person’s authorized representative, may 
submit written comments relevant to the proposed regulatory action to the CIWMB. 
The written comment period closes at 5:00 p.m. on January 14, 2002. The CIWMB 
will only consider comments received at the CIWMB's headquarters by that time. 
Please submit your comments to:</p>

<h4><b>Public Hearing</b></h4>
<p>CIWMB staff will conduct a <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=345&amp;Year=2002&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=1">public 
hearing</a> at 1001 &quot;I&quot; Street, 2nd Floor, Central Valley Auditorium, 
Sacramento, California on January 22-23, 2002. The hearing will begin at 9:30 
a.m. At the hearing, any person may present statements or arguments orally or in 
writing relevant to the proposed amendment to the regulations. The CIWMB 
requests that persons who make oral comments at the hearing also submit a 
written copy of their testimony at the hearing. The hearing room is wheelchair 
accessible.</p>
<h4><b>Informative Digest/Plain English Policy Statement Overview</b></h4>
<p>The Rigid Plastic Packaging Container (RPPC) Act of 1991 (SB 235, Hart, 
Chapter 769) was passed by the Legislature, was approved by the Governor on 
October 9, 1991, and took effect as Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 42300 et 
seq. on January 1, 1992. During 1993, <a href="/Laws/RuleArchive/RPPCRates/">Emergency 
Regulations</a> were adopted by CIWMB, as required by PRC section 42325, and 
became effective on January 1, 1994.</p>
<p>The regulations that were in effect prior to September 17, 2001, do not 
explicitly state how the CIWMB must calculate its recycling rates and do not 
expressly mention using the previous year’s rates for compliance purposes. 
Further, the CIWMB’s past practice has not included the use of previous year’s 
rates. This practice does not give regulated product manufacturers sufficient 
notice in order to comply with the RPPC law by using one of the individual 
methods of compliance, and has resulted in a significant number of manufacturers 
being out of compliance and therefore subject to public hearing and possible 
fines.</p>
<p>However, the CIWMB directed staff to develop emergency regulations to amend 
California Code of Regulations (CCR) section 17943. The emergency regulations 
were filed with the Secretary of State on September 17, 2001.</p>
<p>The statute requires every RPPC offered for sale in California to meet, on 
average, one of six compliance options. These options were designed to encourage 
reuse and recycling of RPPCs, the use of more postconsumer resin in RPPCs and a 
reduction in the amount of virgin resin employed in RPPCs. RPPCs must meet one 
of three design criteria or be recycled at one of three specified rates. The 
CIWMB is required to calculate two of these rates annually; the statewide RPPC 
all-container rate, which is an aggregate recycling rate for all RPPCs, and the 
statewide recycling rate for polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) RPPCs. The 
overall recycling rate accounts for a variety of containers holding products 
such as laundry detergents, motor oil, food, cosmetics, and soft drinks. The 
other recycling rate includes primarily beverage and drink containers made from 
PETE. The statutory minimum rate for the all-container rate is 25%, and is 55% 
for PETE. If either of these recycling rates falls below the statutory minimum, 
CIWMB may require manufacturers to certify that they were individually in 
compliance with one of the other options during that year.</p>
<p>The amended regulation changes the year the recycling rate is used for 
determining compliance with section 17944 (A) or (B) by using the actual 
recycling rate from the previous year to determine compliance in the current 
year, which would provide advance notice to regulated product manufacturers, 
allowing them to take appropriate actions to ensure compliance with the RPPC 
law.</p>
<p><b>Impact on Small Business<br />
</b>The CIWMB has determined that small businesses will be not be impacted by 
the amended regulations.</p>
<p><b>Statement of Availability of Express Terms</b><br />
The express terms of the proposed action written in plain English are available 
from the agency contact person named in this Notice.</p>
<h4>Authority and References</h4>
<p>Public Resources Code sections 40502 and 42325 provide authority for these 
regulations. Public Resources Code sections 42301, 42310 and 42324 are 
references.</p>
<h4>Local Mandates</h4>
<p>The CIWMB has determined that adoption of the change in the timeframe for the 
recycling rates does not impose a mandate on local agencies or school districts, 
or a mandate which requires reimbursement pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with 
Section 17500) of Division 4 of the Government Code.</p>
<h4>Fiscal Impact</h4>
<p>The CIWMB has determined that the proposed change in regulation will not 
result in fiscal impacts, costs or savings, to any state agency, costs or 
savings in federal funds to the state or other nondiscretionary costs or savings 
imposed on local agencies.</p>
<h4>Housing Costs</h4>
<p>The CIWMB has determined that the proposed change will not result in a 
significant impact in housing costs.</p>
<h4>Significant Adverse Economic Impact on Business</h4>
<p>The CIWMB has made an initial determination that the proposed change in 
regulation will not result in significant statewide adverse economic impact 
directly affecting business, including the ability of California businesses to 
compete with businesses in other states.</p>
<h4>Assessment Statement</h4>
<p>The CIWMB has assessed the potential for the proposed change to create or 
eliminate California jobs, create, eliminate or expand businesses within 
California, and has determined that there will be no effect.</p>
<h4>Statement of Potential Cost Impact on Private Persons or Businesses Directly 
Affected</h4>
<p>The CIWMB is not aware of any cost impacts that a representative private 
person or business would necessarily incur in reasonable compliance with the 
proposed action.</p>
<h4>Consideration of Alternatives</h4>
<p>The CIWMB must determine that no reasonable alternative considered, or that 
has otherwise been identified and brought to the attention of the CIWMB, would 
be more effective in carrying out the purpose for which the action is proposed 
or would be as effective and less burdensome to affected parties than the 
proposed action.</p>
<p>The CIWMB invites interested persons to present statements or arguments with 
respect to alternatives to the proposed amendment to the regulations at the 
scheduled hearing or during the written comment period.</p>
