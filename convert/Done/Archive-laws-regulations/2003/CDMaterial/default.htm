    <h2><strong>Rulemaking History</strong></h2>
        <p>Following the close of a 45-day comment period on December 28, 1998, the
    Board held a public hearing in Sacramento on January 13, 1999. At its January 27-28, 1999 meeting, the Board
    directed staff to collect additional information on mine reclamation activities within the
    state and return to the Board to request approval for an additional 15-day comment period.
    At its August 31, 1999 meeting in Sacramento, the Board approved a revised draft of the
    proposed regulations for an additional 15-day comment period. At its <a
    href="/agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=226&amp;Year=1999&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=9">September
    22, 1999 meeting</a>, the Board voted 4-0 to not adopt the proposed C&amp;D/Inert Debris
    regulations and to have further discussions with the State Water Resources Control Board,
    the Department of Conservation, and other stakeholders before developing a new draft.</p>
    <p>In December 2000, the Board approved a two-phase approach to
    reestablishing this
    rulemaking.&nbsp;<strong>Phase I </strong>covers the <strong>transfer and processing</strong>
    of construction, demolition, and inert debris. <strong>Phase II</strong>  covers the <strong>disposal</strong> of construction, demolition, and inert
    debris.</p>
