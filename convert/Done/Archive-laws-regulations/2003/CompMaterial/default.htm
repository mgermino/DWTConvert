 Guidance</a></b></p>
    <p><b>Rulemaking History<br />
    </b>The effort to place these facilities and operations into the regulatory tiers structure
    continued through winter 1999-2000, with informal scoping sessions. 
	<a href="/LEACentral/Organics/OdorIssues/">Public workshops</a>
    held during September 1999 focused on odor monitoring and enforcement at compostable
    organic materials handling sites, as well as on regulatory concepts for the revision of
    compostable organic materials handling regulations.</p>
      <p> During July and August 2000, in eight
    venues throughout the state, the Board held 
		<a href="/LEACentral/Organics/Regs2000/Workshop/">workshops</a>
    to discuss proposed revisions to the regulations. Staff analyzed the
    information gathered at the workshops and in November 2000 revised the draft regulations
    accordingly. In December 2000, Board staff solicited feedback from
      an external working group and, in January 2001, revised the regulations
      based on this feedback. The Board discussed issues related to this
      package at its 
		<a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=266&Year=2001&Comm=BRD&Month=2">February
      20-22, 2001 meeting</a>. At its 
		<a href="/Agendas/default.asp?Year=2001&Month=4&PageType=MonthView">April
      24-25, 2001 meeting</a> the Board directed staff to solicit further 
		<a href="/LEAMemo/2001/CompostRegs/Meeting.htm">stakeholder</a> input and return to the August
      14-15, 2001 meeting for consideration of approval to begin a 45-day
      comment period.</p>
      <p> 
      At the <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=278&Year=2001&Comm=BRD&Month=8">August
      14-15, 2001</a>  Board meeting staff was directed to initiate a 45-day
      public comment period for the proposed text (July 2001 version) of the
      regulations. The comment period ran from March 29 through May 13,
      2002. The Board conducted a public hearing at its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=393&amp;Year=2002&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=5">May
      14, 2002 meeting</a>.</p>

      At its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=411&amp;Year=2002&amp;Comm=PEN&amp;Month=8">August
      12, 2002 meeting</a>  the Permitting and Enforcement Committee directed
      staff to initiate a 15-day comment period for
      changes to regulatory text (July 2002 version). The comment period ran from August 29 through September 13, 2002.</p>
      <p> 
      At its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=424&amp;Year=2002&amp;Comm=PEN&amp;Month=10">October
    7, 2002 meeting</a>  the Permitting and Enforcement Committee directed staff
    to begin a second 15-day public comment period for changes to regulatory
      text (October 2002 version).&nbsp; The comment period ran from October 11 through October 26, 2002.</p>
      <p> 
      The Board adopted the regulations at
    its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=428&Year=2002&Comm=BRD&Month=11">November
    19-20, 2002</a> meeting.
    The Office of Administrative Law approved the regulations on April 4,
