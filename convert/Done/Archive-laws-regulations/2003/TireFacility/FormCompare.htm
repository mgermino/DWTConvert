    	<b>CIWMB 500: Application Form</b><ul>
          <li>The exclusion options on this form have been removed from Section 
          I.  Type of Application, Section II. Type of Facility, and Section 
          VIII  Required Documents. This change will make Form 500 consistent 
          with the most recent proposed changes to the regulations. Section 
          18420(a)(5) has been deleted, and the requirement for retreaders 
          (18420(a)(4)) to complete Form 500 has also been deleted from Section 
          18420.</li>
          <li>The publish date has been updated.</li>
          <li>A check box has been added to this form (moved from form 501) so 
          the operator and owner can see the requirement to attach a copy of the 
          property lease with the application. The requirement to submit the 
          lease is currently in the operation plan. Staff felt it would be more 
          appropriate to place the lease requirement in the application form 
          since both the operator and the owner are required to sign the 
          application form. Only the operator is required to sign the operation 
          form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>CIWMB 501: Operation Plan</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Format change: The form has been updated to a new format and is 
          now consistent with the Form 500 Application Form (that was put into 
          regs. in 1998). Features include check boxes arranged in table format 
          to increase clarity and provide the applicant the option to complete 
          this form on line/electronically.</li>
          <li>On page one the second paragraph that explained that financial 
          assurance requirements were only for major permits has been deleted 
          from this new form because it is redundant to information contained in 
          section VIII. of the application form 500. The sentence about closure 
          information for minor waste tire facilities was also deleted--this 
          information is in the regulations 14 CCR 18440, and does not need to 
          be repeated in the operation plan.</li>
          <li>Added SWIS Number Box.</li>
          <li>Took out lease agreement (section 27) and put that required 
          attachment in the application form 500 under Section VIII. Required 
          Documents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>CIWMB 502: Environmental Information</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Format change: The form has been updated to a new format and is 
          now consistent with the Form 500 Application Form (that was put into 
          regs. in 1998). Features include check boxes arranged in table format 
          to increase clarity and provide the applicant the option to complete 
          this form on line/electronically.</li>
          <li>ADDED: SWIS Number, SCH number and name of environmental document. 
          This will allow the reviewer to quickly find the document and is 
          information that should be in the permit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>CIWMB 503: Emergency Response Plan</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Format change: The form has been updated to a new format and is 
          now consistent with the Form 500 Application Form (that was put into 
          regs. in 1998). Features include check boxes arranged in table format 
          to increase clarity and provide the applicant the option to complete 
          this form on line/electronically.</li>
          <li>Added SWIS Number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>CIWMB 504: Closure Plan</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Format change: The form has been updated to a new format and is 
          now consistent with the Form 500 Application Form (that was put into 
          regs. in 1998). Features include check boxes arranged in table format 
          to increase clarity and provide the applicant the option to complete 
          this form on line/electronically.</li>
          <li>Added/changed language to allow use of alternative formula for 
          closure cost estimate (change in the first sentence on page three) 
          instead of limiting the applicant to the formula provided on this 
          form.</li>
