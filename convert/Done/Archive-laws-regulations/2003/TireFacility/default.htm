    	<b>Description</b><br />
        Proposed regulations to amend existing waste tire facility permitting 
        and storage regulations and to add regulatory enforcement criteria for 
        permitted and unpermitted waste tire facilities.</p>
        <p><b>Affected Regulatory Code Sections</b><br />
    Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Division 7, Chapter 3 (<a href="/Regulations/Title14/ch3a4.htm#ch3a_a4_1">Articles 4.1</a> and 
        <a href="/Regulations/Title14/ch3a55.htm#Article55">5.5</a>) and
        <a href="/Regulations/Title14/default.htm#chapter6">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
      <h2><b>Rulemaking History</b></h2>
      <p>Public workshops were held in October 1999 to
    receive informal public comment on the proposed regulations. The formal
      rulemaking process was put on hold pending the outcome of proposed legislation
      (<a href="/Tires/FiveYearPlan/SB876.htm">SB 876</a>--Escutia, Statutes of 
      2000, Chapter 838) that impacted the current proposed regulations.  </p>
      <p>A 45-day public review and comment period was noticed in the 
      California Regulatory Notice Register on July 12, 2002. Public comments 
      were accepted through August 26, 2002.&nbsp;Board staff  conducted a public 
      hearing on September 9, 2002.</p>
      <p>Comments from the 45-day public comment period and public hearing were presented at the
      <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=425&Year=2002&Comm=SWMD&Month=10">
      October 7, 2002, Special Waste and Market Development Committee meeting</a>. 
      Board staff proposed additional changes to the regulations. The Committee 
      directed staff to make these proposed changes available to the public for 
      a 30-day comment period that ran from October 11-November 11, 2002. </p>
      <p>The proposed changes included the addition of a new Article 11 in 
      Chapter 6 entitled �Financial Assurances Enforcement Procedures for Major 
      Waste Tire Facilities.� In addition, Forms 500-504 have been reformatted 
      (with a few minor changes) to be more user friendly. The only change in 
      Form 500 is the publication date. There were other minor changes.</p>
        <p>Staff returned to the Committee and Board in December 2002 for 
        adoption of the proposed regulations. The proposed regulations were 
        adopted by the Board at its
        <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=429&Year=2002&Comm=BRD&Month=12">
        December 10, 2002</a>, meeting. The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved these regulations on April 
        1, 2003.&nbsp; The regulations became effective on the 30th day after OAL 
        filed them with the Secretary of State.</p>
