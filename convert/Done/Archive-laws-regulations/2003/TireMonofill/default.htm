    	<b>Description</b><br />
        Regulations for permitting of tire monofills under the solid waste
      regulations, as well as standards for monofilling within solid waste
      facilities.</p>
        <p><b>Affected Regulatory Code Sections<br />
        </b><a href="/Regulations/Title14/#chapter3">Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Division 7, Chapter 3</a> Article 5.4, Sections 17346 through 17349</p>
      <p>
      <b>Rulemaking History</b><br />
      Board staff held public workshops in October 1999 to
      receive informal public comment on the proposed Tire Facility, Haulers, and Monofill
      regulations. At its February 2000 meeting the Board directed staff to separate proposed
      tire monofill regulations from the Tire Facility, Haulers, and Monofill
      package, and to conduct <a href="/Tires/Events/Monofill/">workshops</a> on
      waste tire monofilling prior to reporting back to the Board in June 2000.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Board staff held a second workshop on June 12, 2000, to discuss, among other
      topics, the permitting of tire monofills under the solid waste permitting
      regulations. The consensus at the meeting was that the permitting of tire
      monofills should be part of the solid waste disposal facility regulations,
      but that the requirements for tire monofill cells at existing solid waste
      disposal facilities should be handled under a later regulation package in
      order not to impede the progress of the tire monofill regulations.&nbsp;At the <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=240&amp;Year=2000&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=6"> June
      20-21, 2000 Board
      meeting</a>, the Board directed staff to separate the monofill
      regulations into two phases and to give first priority to the permitting
      of tire monofills under the solid waste regulations. The setting of
      standards for codisposal within solid waste facilities will follow.</p>
      <p> Staff distributed draft tire monofill regulations
      for comment on March 7, 2001. Board staff held a third workshop  on March 12, 2001 to discuss the draft
      regulations.&nbsp;On April 12, 2001 the Board staff held a fourth workshop.</p>
      <p> At its <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=272&amp;Year=2001&amp;Comm=BRD&amp;Month=5">May
      22-23,
      2001 meeting</a>  the Board approved the regulations, with minor changes,
      for a 45-day public comment period. The comment period ran from September
      6 through October 21, 2002. The Board held a public hearing at the <a href="http://Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=464&amp;Year=2002&amp;Comm=PEN&amp;Month=11">November
      12, 2002</a> Permitting and Enforcement Committee meeting.</p>

        6,
        2003 meeting</a> the Permitting and Enforcement Committee directed staff
        to begin a 15-day public comment period on changes to the proposed text.
        The comment period ran from January 17 through February 3, 2003.</p>
      <p> 
        At its <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=474&amp;Year=2003&amp;Comm=PEN&amp;Month=3">March
