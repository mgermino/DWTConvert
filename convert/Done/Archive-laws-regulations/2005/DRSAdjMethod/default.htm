        7, 2002, Diversion, Planning and Local Assistance Committee meeting</a> 
        (Committee Item C) as an informational item. </p>
		<p>Notification of these proposed regulations was sent to stakeholders 
        in mid-November, thus beginning the informal rulemaking process. Public 
        workshops were held in Sacramento and Diamond Bar in early December 
        2002. Written comments on the first informal draft regulations were due 
        January 3, 2003.</p>

        was presented at the <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=461&amp;Year=2003&amp;Comm=DPLA&amp;Month=1">January
        8, 2003, Diversion, Planning and Local Assistance Committee meeting</a>
        (Committee Item D) as an informational item.</p>
		<p>In March 2003, Board staff conducted two sessions of focused
        workshops on subtopics within the scope of this regulations package.
        (See &quot;<a href="#Stakeholder">Stakeholder Input</a>&quot; below.)</p>
		<p>In June 2003, notification of the proposed second informal draft 
		regulations was sent to stakeholders. Staff conducted two public 
		workshops on this version of proposed regulations on June 24 and 26, 
		2003. (See <a href="#Stakeholder">Stakeholder Input</a> below.) 
        Written comments on the second informal draft Disposal Reporting System 
        regulations were due July 18, 2003.</p>
		<p>On November 4, 2003, the Sustainability and Market Development 
        Committee gave approval to formally notice the revised Disposal Reporting System and Adjustment Method 
        regulations with a minor change to the text. Board Agenda Item 26 
        (Committee Item M) attachments, including regulations text, and a 
        presentation are available on the

        Board's Agenda web page</a>. </p>
		<p><a href="default.htm">Proposed Regulations: California Integrated 
		Waste Management Board</a> The first formal 45ï¿½day public comment period ran from September 3 
		through October 18, 2004. The notice of proposed rulemaking concerning 
		the Disposal Reporting System and Adjustment Method was published in the 
		California Regulatory Notice Register (September 3, 2004 publication 
		date). The comment period closed at 5:00 P.M. on October 18, 2004 (See 
		Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the details of the public hearing).</p>
		<p>A public hearing was held on October 18, 2004 and the first formal 
		45-day public comment period ended on the same day. Board staff noted 
		oral comments heard at the public hearing and accepted written comments 
		received during the comment period. At the public hearing, four speakers 
		requested an additional 45 days for further review and comment on the 
		proposed Disposal Reporting System regulations. In addition, Board staff 
		identified some minor corrections to incorporate into the proposed 
		revised regulations. </p>
		<p>An agenda item was presented to the Sustainability and Market 
		Development Committee on November 3, 2004 to discuss and request 
		direction on an additional 45-day comment period for the revised 
		Adjustment Method and Disposal Reporting System regulations. A few 
		stakeholders expressed their concerns about the revised regulations at 
		the meeting. There were requests to include additional language into the 
		revised Disposal Reporting System regulations and have the comment 
		period end on January 15, 2005 or later since the additional 45-day 
		comment period might otherwise end during the holidays. The Sustainability and 
		Market Development Committee directed staff to include the additional 
		language in the revised Disposal Reporting System regulations and extend 
		the additional 45-day comment period to mid-January. Board Agenda Item 7 
		(Committee Item F) attachments, including regulations text, and a 
		presentation are available on the
		<a href="/Agendas/default.asp?Month=11&Year=2004&Go=Go">Board's Agenda web page</a>.</p>
		<p>A second 45-day comment period on proposed revised regulations ended 
		on January 18, 2005.</p>
		<p>Issues identified by stakeholders during the first and second 45-day 
		comment periods were discussed at a workshop held as part of the 
		Sustainability and Market Development Committee meeting on April 12, 
		2005. See &quot;Stakeholder Input&quot; section for more information, including 
		the workshop notice and issue paper used during the workshop. Written 
		comments on issues identified in the workshop issue paper were also 
		accepted through April 15, 2005.</p>
		<p>At the May 11, 2005 Board meeting, the Board gave staff direction 
		to formally notice revised regulations for a 15-day comment period (See
		<a href="#RulemakngDoc">Rulemaking Documents</a>). The 
		comment period ran from May 16, 2005 June 1, 2005. By State law 
		the Board was only required to respond to comments related to the 
		changes made to the regulations for the 15-day comment period (<i>italicized 
		text</i>). However, the Board directed staff to also consider further 
		comments on origin survey frequency (see sections 18809.6 18810.6, 
		18811.6, 18812.6, 18813.6 18814.6).</p>
		<p>At its June 14, 2005 meeting the Board adopted the proposed revised 
		regulations and the associated Negative Declaration (See
		<a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=1044&Year=2005&Comm=BRD&Month=6">
		Agenda Item 25 of the June 14-15, 2005 Board meeting agenda</a>). On 
		August 12, 2005, Board staff submitted the final rulemaking file to the 
		Office of Administrative Law for a 30-day working day review. </p>
		<p>On September 21, 2005 the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved 
		the regulations and filed them with the Secretary of State. The 
		regulations become effective January 1, 2006.</p>
