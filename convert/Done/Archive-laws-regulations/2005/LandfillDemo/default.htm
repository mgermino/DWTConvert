        </strong>Board staff  conducted a
        <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=944&Year=2004&Comm=WKS&Month=6">workshop on 
        June 28,
    2004</a>, in Sacramento, to solicit comment on informal draft regulation

		April 18 through 5:00 p.m. on May 3, 2005.
        The Board adopted the regulations at its

		14, 2005</a> meeting.</p>
