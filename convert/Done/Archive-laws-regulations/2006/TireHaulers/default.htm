		<p><b>Description</b><br />
        Revision of existing waste tire hauler registration and manifest 
		regulations to introduce the Comprehensive Trip Log form (CIWMB 203) as 
		a replacement form for the current Manifest form (CIWMB 647) and Tire 
		Trip Log form (CIWMB 648). Additionally, establish criteria for 
		submittal of electronic data to the Board, in lieu of the required paper 
		form(s). The proposed changes implement, interpret and make specific the 
		provisions of Chapter 838, Statutes of 2000 (Escutia, SB 876), as well 
		as correct errors, add language to make the regulations more functional, 
		and delete unnecessary language.</p>
<p>The retreader regulations that were 
approved by OAL in September 2005 were repealed as a result of this regulatory 
change. Retreaders must now 
comply with the new Comprehensive Trip Log requirements.</p>
