		<p>The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved the regulations and filed 
		them with the Secretary of State on March 14, 2007. The regulations are 
		effective on April 13, 2007.</p>
		<p><b><a name="Background">Background</a></b></p>
		<p>In January 2004,
		<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/asm/ab_1451-1500/ab_1497_bill_20031011_chaptered.html">AB 1497</a> was enacted. The new law mandates several new solid waste 
		facility permitting requirements and authorizes the Board to adopt 
		regulations to implement these requirements. At its
		<a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=750&Year=2004&Comm=BRD&Month=1">
		January 2004 meeting</a>, the Board directed staff to address, in a 
		rulemaking, the application of new construction &amp; demolition 
		requirements to other solid waste facility and local enforcement agency 
		requirements. Finally, in early 2004 the Board staff consulted with 
		stakeholders to solicit their input on what they viewed as areas for 
		improvement, consistency, and clarification related to the permitting 
		process and/or requirements.</p>
		<p>During the second half of 2004, Board staff solicited stakeholder 
		input on regulatory concepts associated with the issues above via a 
		process entitled the <a href="/Laws/Rulemaking/SWFPDevPlan/default.htm">Solid Waste 
		Facility Permit Regulation Development Plan</a>. At its
		<a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=962&Year=2004&Comm=PEN&Month=11">
		November 2004 meeting</a>, the Board's Permitting and Enforcement 
		Committee directed staff to implement the plan through three separate 
		and staggered rulemakings. This rulemaking, Permit Implementation 
		Regulations (AB 1497), is the first of the three rulemakings.</p>
		<p>
		<b><a name="History">Rulemaking History</a></b></p>
		<p>To kick start the informal development of this rulemaking, a 
		<a href="/LEA/WorkGroup/default.htm">team of Board staff and local enforcement agency representatives</a> studied the issues and developed proposed approaches to address the issues. The process on developing approaches to address each key issue is shared on these web pages.</p>
		<p>The Board conducted public workshops on the first round of proposals 
		for addressing each key issue on April 4, 2005, in Sacramento and on 
		April 7, 2005, in Diamond Bar.</p>
		<p>At the <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=1040&Year=2005&Comm=PEN&Month=6">June 
		6, 2005</a>, Permitting and Enforcement Committee meeting, staff provided an 
		oral update on the developments to date on the project, a brief summary 
		of comments received during the informal scoping phase, and the next 
		steps for the rulemaking package, prior to commencing the formal 
		rulemaking process.</p>
		<p>On August 22, 2005, Board staff conducted a 
		public workshop in Sacramento to solicit input on preliminary draft 
		regulatory text (see <a href="#RulemakingDocs">Rulemaking Documents</a> 
		below). The Board webcast the live audio of the 
		workshop.&nbsp;Additionally, 
		several &quot;teleconferencing&quot; locations were available. An informal comment period on 
		the preliminary draft regulatory text ran through September 9, 2005.</p>
		<p>At its
		<a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=1067&Year=2005&Comm=PEN&Month=11">
		November 7, 2005</a>, meeting the Permitting and Enforcement Committee 
		directed staff to initiate a 60-day comment period on the proposed regulations and to work with stakeholders in the development of two lists that could be inserted into the 
		regulations prior to beginning the comment period: first, a list of 
		minor changes that would not require LEA review and approval prior to 
		the operator taking action, and, second, a list of changes that would 
		always require a revision to the permit. A work group formed to generate 
		the lists met November 21 and 29, 2005.</p>
		<p>The Board made an informal, informational presentation on the draft proposed regulations on April 3 in Sacramento and on April 5 in Diamond Bar (refer to the <a href="#Stakeholder">Stakeholder Input</a> below for more details).</p>
		<p>Board staff prepared an
		initial analysis and draft 
		response (<a href="Comment60Day/DraftRespons.pdf">Adobe PDF</a>, 222 KB |
		<a href="Comment60Day/DraftRespons.doc">MS Word</a>, 305 KB) to comments on major issues received 
		during the 60-day formal 
		public comment period which ran from April 7, 2006, 
		through June 6, 2006, and the comments received at the

		<p>On
		<a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=1149&Year=2006&Comm=PEN&Month=9">September 
		5, 2006</a>, after considering staff's recommendations, the comments 
		received from the public, and the discussion of the matter by the 
		Board's Permitting and Enforcement Committee, the chair of the Committee 
		directed staff to make further modifications to the proposed text and to 
		notice a 15-day comment period.</p>
		<p>A <a href="RuleDocs/15Notice1.pdf">15-day public comment period</a> on changes to the 
		<a href="RuleDocs/15Text1.pdf">proposed regulation text</a> ran from
