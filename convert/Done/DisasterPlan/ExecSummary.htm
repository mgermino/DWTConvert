<p><strong>Authority</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Integrated Waste Management Disaster Plan has been prepared pursuant to Assembly Bill 2920 (Lee, 1992, Stats. 1992, c.436).
This legislation requires the Board to develop a plan that provides for the handling,
storage, processing, transportation, diversion from disposal sites, or disposal where
absolutely necessary, of solid waste, resulting from a state or local emergency. This
mandate is codified in Public Resources Code (PRC) section 43035. </p>

<p>The Plan has been prepared in consultation with the Governor's Office of Emergency
Services (OES) with input from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Local
Enforcement Agencies, local emergency services personnel, local solid waste coordinators,
and the public.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Board role</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The California Integrated Waste Management Board (Board)
is committed to assuring that solid waste is properly managed in the event of a natural
disaster or emergency. </p>

<p>One of the Board's goals is to assist in the expeditious recovery of areas affected by
natural disasters or emergencies while providing for the protection of public health and
safety. To the maximum degree feasible, the Board will form partnerships with local
jurisdictions in the development of debris management plans to recycle, reuse, or
otherwise divert disaster debris from disposal.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Advance planning</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The key to a successful disaster debris management
program is advance planning. In the aftermath of a disaster, the primary focus is
restoring and maintaining public health and safety. Consequently, debris diversion
programs such as recycling and reuse can quickly become secondary, to be established only
if there are time and staff to undertake the effort, if at all. </p>

<p>Preparedness will assist the State in diverting significant amounts of valuable
materials that would otherwise be disposed of. Furthermore, there will be the added
benefit of preservation of the State's landfill capacity.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Need for plan</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The debris left after a major disaster such as an
earthquake, fire, or flood can be massive and create its own set of public health and
safety problems. </p>

<p>Given the magnitude of the cleanup efforts after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 and
the devastating fires in Oakland and Malibu in 1991, it became clear that having a debris
management plan in place before a disaster is critical to diverting massive amounts of
debris from landfills. </p>

<p>Had recycling and reuse programs not been established after these disasters, more than
a million tons of disaster debris would have been disposed of. The City of Los Angeles'
Earthquake Recycling Program alone (established after the 1994 Northridge earthquake)
saved 1,629,788 tons, or about 5,350,000 cubic yards of landfill space. </p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This plan is designed to provide guidance and assistance to
the disaster preparedness planning efforts of local government. Its primary purpose is to
assist local jurisdictions in writing a disaster debris management plan for their
communities and to encourage the establishment of diversion programs for the debris
generated after a disaster.</p>

<p>To this end, the plan provides an overview of the debris management issues that a solid
waste manager will face after a disaster and highlights those diversion programs that have
been proven to be successful. </p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attachments</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Attached to the respective chapters of the plan will be
supporting documents such as sample disaster debris removal contracts that provide for
waste diversion, a model mutual aid agreement, and other guidance documents to assist the
Solid Waste Recycling Coordinators in their efforts related to emergency disposal and
diversion of disaster debris. </p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Plan organization</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The plan is divided into 17 chapters that cover the
various aspects of a debris management strategy. Because these chapters were prepared and
can be used as stand-alone documents, some material is repeated in various chapters. </p>

<p>There are four major parts to the plan:

<ol>
  <li>Chapters 1-12 focus on government coordination, predisaster planning, and 
  debris management programs.</li>
  <li>Chapters 13-16 focus on the emergency management system.</li>
  <li>Chapter 17 consists of case studies of the 1991 Oakland Firestorm, and the 
  City of Los Angeles and the City of Santa Clarita responses to the 1994 
  Northridge earthquake.</li>
  <li>Checklists at the beginning of chapters summarize the tasks to be 
  undertaken by local government, primarily the designated debris manager and 
  team.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Checklists</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Abbreviated checklists are included below to provide a
summary of the tasks to be undertaken in implementing diversion programs. These checklists
can be used as a shortcut to determining the debris strategy to be undertaken and the
programs to be implemented. </p>

<p>Only those chapter checklists related to debris programs [those denoted with an
asterisk (*) ] are included for easy reference in the Plan. The remaining chapters contain
a brief description of the chapter highlights.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Debris manager</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The checklists are intended for the debris
jurisdiction's manager; that is, the person designated with the responsibility for
coordinating the debris clearance/removal activities and establishing diversion programs
for the disaster debris. It is also assumed that a debris &quot;team&quot; will be
established to assist in the debris management operations.</p>

<h2><a name="chapterone">Chapter 1</a>: Government Coordination</h2>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> In the event of a disaster, local government officials
must know whom to contact for assistance and must understand the roles and
responsibilities of the other governmental agencies involved in order to effectively
coordinate recovery efforts. This chapter outlines the roles and responsibilities of the
local, state, and federal agencies with respect to disaster debris management. </p>

<p>In addition, it is critical that a jurisdiction establish effective coordination within
its own organization. Information covered includes:

<ul>
  <li>A description of an emergency organization in terms of who is responsible for what;
    identification of departmental relationships; </li>
  <li>Designation of a debris manager and team;</li>
  <li>Identification of a management structure; </li>
  <li>Identification of available resources (staff and equipment); and description of mutual
    aid agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Step 1: Define intradepartmental relationships, designate a debris
manager and establish a debris &quot;team.&quot;<br />
Step 3: Outline and evaluate potential for specific disaster events
and develop functional checklists by disaster for debris manager and team.<br />
Step 4: Become familiar with emergency plans, procedures, and the
Standardized Emergency Management System. <br />
Step 5: Identify local, state, and federal agencies involved in
disaster debris management.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="chaptertwo">Chapter 2</a>: Predisaster Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> This chapter discusses the need to conduct a program
assessment in each community to determine the quantity and types of materials likely to be
generated in a particular disaster. This is important because development of particular
diversion programs will depend on the type and amount of debris generated as well as the
end-uses identified for the materials. </p>

<p>Further, by conducting a pre-disaster assessment, a jurisdiction will have identified
the specific areas that must be developed in a debris management plan. </p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Contents:</strong> Brief descriptions of the other types of information to be
included in this assessment are:

<ul>
  <li>Identification of type of disaster likely to occur in a particular 
  locality.</li>
  <li>Identification of transportation corridors and development of alternate 
  routes.</li>
  <li>Identification of recyclers, haulers, and processors in the area available 
  to handle the debris.</li>
  <li>Contingency plans for waste disposal.</li>
  <li>Identification of temporary storage or staging areas for debris.</li>
  <li>Facilities to handle/process debris and the amount that can be handled.</li>
  <li>Markets for the generated materials.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preplanning:</strong> Preplanning is the most effective way to ensure diversion activities
are carried out after a disaster. By having local policies in place to require that
recycling or other diversion programs be implemented after a disaster, or routinely, can
lend critical support to a jurisdiction's request to receive FEMA reimbursement for
recycling or other diversion programs.</p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Step 1: Develop local checklists of available resources.<br />
Step 2: Conduct a disaster event analysis and waste characterization
analysis.<br />
Step 3: Identify temporary storage sites.<br />
Step 4: Identify end uses and markets.<br />
Step 5: Identify facilities and processing operations.<br />
Step 6: Identify processing techniques and barriers.<br />
Step 7: Identify processing equipment needs.<br />
Step 8: Review funding options.<br />
Step 9: Determine contract needs.<br />
Step 10: Review Mutual Aid Agreements.<br />
Step 11: Identify labor needs.<br />
Step 12: Review local ordinances.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="chapterthree">Chapter 3</a>: Debris Management Programs</h2>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> This chapter contains the &quot;how-to&quot; information a
local jurisdiction would need to establish a debris management program. Three programs are
highlighted: curbside collection, building demolition, and household hazardous waste. The
primary issues and the minimum requirements that should be considered in establishing such
programs are presented below:

<ul>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="chapterfour">Chapter 4</a>: Temporary Storage Sites</h2>

<p><strong>Need for:</strong> Local governments have identified temporary storage sites as
the primary obstacle in establishing a debris management program. Without the ability to
stockpile or store the disaster debris until such time as a jurisdiction can turn its
attention to processing and marketing the materials, the debris is probably destined for
the landfill.</p>

<p><strong>Do beforehand:</strong> Securing storage sites is best done before a disaster
so that arrangements, such as leases and permits for the land, can be accomplished
quickly. Given that the immediate response is for lifesaving activities, recycling and
diversion programs often become secondary in importance. Having storage sites available in
advance gives a jurisdiction additional time to develop diversion strategies and programs
to handle the disaster debris.</p>

<p><strong>Contents:</strong> This chapter will discuss determining the need for temporary
storage sites and the criteria to use in selecting such sites. </p>

<p><strong>Waiver of standards:</strong> In addition, the emergency waiver of standards
regulations can provide some additional options for jurisdictions in establishing
temporary storage sites. (The regulations are found in California Code of Regulations,
Title 14, Division 7, Chapter 3, Article 3, sections 17210 through 17210.9).</p>

<p>If authorized by the Local Enforcement Agency, an emergency waiver of standards can be
granted to a solid waste facility operator to establish a locally-approved temporary
transfer or processing site in the event of a proclamation of a state of emergency. </p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Step 1: Determine need for facilities.<br />
Step 2: Develop criteria to evaluate potential sites.<br />
Step 3: Identify temporary storage sites.<br />
Step 4: Consult with local solid waste facility operator and Local
Enforcement Agency on Emergency Waiver of Standards regarding establishment of temporary
storage or processing areas.<br />
Step 5: Identify permits or variances.<br />
Step 6: Perform environmental review of site.<br />
Step 7: Prepare a site development and operation plan.<br />
Step 8: Prepare inspection and site management guidelines.<br />
Step 9: Prepare a site restoration plan.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="chapterfive">Chapter 5</a>: Contracts</h2>

<p><strong>Importance of: </strong>Contracts and franchise agreements are pivotal to
ensuring a successful debris management program. Unless diversion is specified, it is
likely the collected debris will be disposed of. By developing model contracts for debris
removal and recycling, and by prequalifying contractors in advance, a jurisdiction can
save valuable time in implementing its recovery operations.</p>

<p>Regardless of the diversion program selected, the best way to divert disaster debris
from landfills is to ensure that the contracts for debris removal include provisions
requiring that the disaster debris be diverted from landfills through reuse, recycling, or
other waste diversion techniques. Examples of contract language requiring diversion of
disaster debris are included for reference. </p>

<p><strong>Options: </strong>The jurisdiction has a number of options available in
preparing contracts, depending upon the nature of the disaster and the expected recovery
time. This chapter presents the time and material, lump sum, and unit price contracts,
describing the advantages and disadvantages of each. </p>

<p>Contract agreements are often the vehicle through which the debris removal and
recycling operations will occur. As a result, it is important for a jurisdiction to work
closely with its waste hauler or franchise prior to a disaster to determine the services
and equipment they can provide in a disaster. These companies can provide essential
services and equipment as a jurisdiction develops its debris management strategy and
programs. </p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Step 1: Perform contract services assessment.<br />
Step 2: Coordinate with haulers.<br />
Step 3: Assess need for short- and long-term operations. <br />
Step4: Select and execute contract.<br />
Step 5: Determine need for special engineering organization.<br />
Step 6: Develop project quantity/cost estimates.<br />
Step 7: Develop diversion language for contracts.<br />
Step 8: Review general considerations.<br />
Step 9: Review accounting considerations.<br />
Step 10: Review contract administration procedures</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="chaptersix">Chapter 6</a>: Reimbursement</h2>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> A disaster can be devastating to a jurisdiction's
resources, both in personnel and in funds. The job of protecting lives and property will
begin immediately after the disaster; however, funding from the State and FEMA will not
follow so quickly. </p>

<p>To get started in its recovery efforts, a jurisdiction must be knowledgeable about the
state and federal reimbursement programs and the process for requesting funding. This
chapter also provides guidelines for receiving reimbursement for recycling programs even
if they are not &quot;least cost&quot; as is FEMA's policy.</p>

<h2><a name="chapterseven"></a>Chapter 7: Mutual Aid</h2>

<p><strong>Statewide system:</strong> Because California's disaster planning is based on a
statewide system of mutual aid, this will be one of the first options a jurisdiction will
use to get additional staffing and equipment. </p>

<p class="ListIntro">Each local jurisdiction relies first on its own resources, then calls for assistance:

<ul>
  <li>City to city.</li>
  <li>City to county.</li>
  <li>County to county.</li>
  <li>County to the regional office of the Office of Emergency Services, which relays the
    request to the State.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p class="ListIntro">This chapter provides an overview of the different mutual aid agreements that a
jurisdiction can develop or become a signatory to:

<ul>
  <li>Public Works Mutual Aid.</li>
  <li>Public Information Officers Mutual Aid.</li>
  <li>Emergency Managers Mutual Aid.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="chaptereight"></a>Chapter 8: Curbside Collection Program</h2>

<p><strong>Program type:</strong> One of the primary methods used by jurisdictions to
remove material after a disaster is a curbside waste pickup program. Cities and counties
implement curbside pickup programs to remove debris from the street after businesses and
homeowners have placed the materials in front of the property. </p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> In any curbside pickup program, there are some basic
requirements that need to be addressed and implemented. Following is a partial list of
topics discussed in more detail in the Plan.

<ul>
  <li>Processing and facility needs.</li>
  <li>Labor and equipment needs.</li>
  <li>Funding requirements.</li>
  <li>Method of implementation.</li>
  <li>Contract requirements.</li>
  <li>Temporary storage requirements.</li>
  <li>Public information strategy.</li>
  <li>Market requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Step 1: Identify/quantify material.<br />
Step 2: Determine processing and facility needs.<br />
Step 3: Identify labor and equipment needs.<br />

<h2><a name="chapternine">Chapter 9</a>: Building Demolition Program</h2>

<p><strong>Contents:</strong> This chapter sets forth general guidelines for establishing
a building demolition program, emphasizing diversion (reuse, recycling) of waste generated
as a result of the demolition. The information presented here is taken primarily from the:

<ul>
  <li>City of Los Angeles' building demolition and debris removal program initiated after the
    1994 Northridge earthquake, and the County of Humboldt's demolition program after the 1992
    earthquake. </li>
  <li>These demolition programs are offered as examples of how two jurisdictions approached
    the task of setting up such a program. </li>
</ul>

<p>Maximize diversion: In addition, ideas on how to maximize diversion
opportunities, and hints and policy actions undertaken by other jurisdictions after past
disasters are offered to help others avoid common pitfalls in implementing a building
demolition program.</p>

<p><strong>Eligible work:</strong> The planning phase is important in identifying the
types of building demolition work eligible for federal public assistance demolition
funding. This information in turn will help determine the types and scope of building
demolition programs a jurisdiction may choose to undertake.</p>

<h2><a name="chapterten">Chapter 10</a>: Household Hazardous Waste and Disaster 
Planning</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this chapter is to provide assistance to local
jurisdictions in developing a disaster plan for the collection of household hazardous
wastes (HHW). The purpose of disaster planning for HHW is to minimize potential public
health and safety impacts, as well as to minimize costs and confusion. </p>

<p>While many local jurisdictions already have comprehensive collection programs for HHW,
these programs may need to be modified to allow the program to operate adequately during a
disaster. A good disaster plan can help meet these needs. </p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Coordinate plan:</strong> For cities that participate in a county collection
program, a disaster plan should be developed in conjunction with the county. In addition,
a disaster plan should be developed in consultation with the following:

<ul>
  <li>Local/regional emergency management agencies.</li>
  <li>Fire departments.</li>
  <li>Police. </li>
  <li>Other local entities that may be involved in disaster and/or HHW collection programs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus is HHW:</strong> While some of the information contained in this chapter
may apply to hazardous materials emergency response, the focus of this chapter is on
household hazardous waste collection programs. </p>

<h2><a name="chaptereleven">Chapter 11</a>: Public Information Program</h2>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Background:</strong> The success of a diversion program lies with the
effectiveness of its public information or outreach program. An effective public
information program will realize two goals:

<ul>
  <li>Provide adequate advertisement of the debris collection program.</li>
  <li>Educate the residents and contractors involved in carrying out the program. </li>
</ul>

<p>Unless this program is taken seriously and resources applied to implement it, plans to
recycle and otherwise divert the disaster debris may go unrealized. </p>

<p>Good communication is paramount to achieving coordination and consistency within a
jurisdiction's various departments and with the state and federal agencies assisting in
the disaster recovery. As such, elevating the importance of the public information
function will assist the debris manager in carrying out the selected diversion programs
and in accomplishing the program goals.</p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Checklist</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Step 1: Establish a public information or media center to handle
debris management questions from the public.<br />
Step 2: Develop contact lists for the media.<br />
Step 3: Set up a hotline for the public to call regarding debris
management programs and/or for debris pickup.<br />
Step 4: Coordinate jurisdiction's outreach materials for debris
management program with jurisdiction's Public Information Officer and Office of Emergency
Services.<br />
Step 5: Advertise recycling and diversion programs.<br />
Step 6: Identify all target groups.<br />
Step 7: Determine need for interpreters and translators.<br />
Step 8: Provide fact sheets to the public.<br />
Step 9: Develop public information campaign.<br />
Step 10: Develop a Public Information Mutual Aid Plan.</p>

<h2><a name="chaptertwelve">Chapter 12</a>: Rebuilding Using Recycled-Content 
Products</h2>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Background:</strong> After the disaster recovery is well underway, residents
and businesses will begin rebuilding. Rebuilding includes two aspects that are important
for disaster planning:

<ul>
  <li>Selecting <a href="/BuyRecycled/">recycled-content products</a> (RCP) for 
  building.</li>
  <li>Separating materials at the construction job site to maximize recovery. </li>
</ul>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Products:</strong> The key to diverting <a href="/ConDemo/">construction and demolition (C&amp;D)
debris</a> is to promote products using the debris as feedstock. Recycled-content construction
products are discussed in two categories:

<ul>
  <li>Inerts.</li>
  <li>General building products.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Suggested actions:</strong> This chapter presents the following lists of
actions to:

<ul>
  <li>Promote recycled-content products with public works personnel.</li>
  <li>Encourage RCP selection.</li>
  <li>Assist manufacturers with financing or assistance with permits if they are 
  expanding or in startup phase.</li>
  <li>Encourage separation and recycling of construction waste at new construction sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also included are sources of information on construction-related RCPs.</p>

<h2><a name="chapterthirteen">Chapter 13</a>: Standardized Emergency Management 
System</h2>

<p><strong>Background: </strong>As a result of the 1991 East Bay Hills Fire in Oakland,
Senate Bill 1841 was passed by the Legislature and made effective 1/1/93. The law is found
in Section 8607 of the California Government Code. The intent of this law is to improve
the coordination of state and local emergency response in California. The Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS) regulations took effect in September of 1994.</p>

<p>The use of SEMS is required for state response agencies. Local government agencies must
use SEMS if they are to receive state funding for extraordinary response personnel costs
resulting from a disaster.</p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Five levels:</strong> SEMS consists of five organizational levels which are
activated as necessary:

<ul>
  <li>Field response.</li>
  <li>Local government.</li>
  <li>Operational area.</li>
  <li>Regional.</li>
  <li>State.</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter discusses the five SEMS organizational/ response levels and their place in
the overall emergency response system.</p>

<h2><a name="chapterfourteen">Chapter 14</a>: Emergency and Disaster Declaration 
Process</h2>

<p><strong>Process:</strong> The process to request state and/or federal assistance after
a disaster or emergency is initiated when the local governing body or Governor submits a
formal request to the appropriate state or federal office. </p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Assistance:</strong> Program and financial assistance will vary depending on:

<ul>
  <li>The type of declaration or proclamation declared.</li>
  <li>Whether the situation constitutes an emergency or a disaster.</li>
  <li>The assistance required. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> This chapter covers the declaration of a local emergency,
funding for the NDAA program, and the assistance available with a Governor's Proclamation
of a State of Emergency.</p>

<h2><a name="chapterfifteen">Chapter 15</a>: State Natural Disaster Assistance (NDAA) 
Program</h2>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Background:</strong> The Natural Disaster Assistance Act (NDAA) is activated
after:

<ul>
  <li>A local declaration of emergency.</li>
  <li>Governor's Proclamation of a State Emergency.</li>
  <li>A Presidential Declaration of a Major Disaster or Emergency. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the NDAA is activated, local government is eligible for certain types of
assistance, depending upon the specific declaration or proclamation issued. This chapter
outlines the types of assistance available and the application procedure for requesting
that assistance.</p>

<h2><a name="chaptersixteen">Chapter 16</a>: Federal Public Assistance Program</h2>

<p><strong>Background: </strong>It is the responsibility of the local communities and the
State to respond when a natural disaster occurs; however, the results of the disaster may
overwhelm their combined efforts to effectively handle the recovery. In these instances,
the State can request federal assistance to supplement the state and local efforts.</p>

<p>This chapter provides an overview of federal assistance available under the Robert T.
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the Federal Response Plan. </p>

<h2><a name="chapterseventeen">Chapter 17</a>: Case Studies</h2>

<p>Three case studies are included in this plan--the
1991 Oakland Firestorm, and the City of Los Angeles and the City of Santa Clarita
responses to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The case studies examine how each city
established diversion programs to handle the disaster debris generated within their
communities and offer some lessons learned and planning guidelines for future events. </p>

<p>This information is presented in the hope that other jurisdictions can learn from these
cities' experiences and incorporate these suggestions into their own predisaster plans by
maximizing water diversion efforts and utilizing existing resources to the greatest
benefit.</p>
