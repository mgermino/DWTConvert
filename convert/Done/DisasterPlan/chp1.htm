	<p><strong>Background:</strong> The key to organizing an immediate and effective recovery
program after a disaster is government coordination, both internal and external. </p>

<p>It is important to identify how you/your department fits into the &quot;big
picture&quot; of emergency response and recovery. Principal points to cover include
identifying: 

<ul>
  <li>how your jurisdiction will respond in a particular disaster; </li>
  <li>who should be involved from your agency; </li>
  <li>how resources will be coordinated; </li>
  <li>the local, state, and federal agencies involved in the recovery process; and</li>
  <li>the process to follow in requesting state and federal assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing these things in advance will save valuable time in establishing programs to
handle the influx of disaster debris that is inevitable with major disasters. </p>

<p><strong>Contents:</strong> The four steps to take in setting up your emergency
organization and establishing contacts with the appropriate local, state, and federal
agencies involved in disaster debris management are outlined below:</p>

	<h2><a name="sone">Step 1</a>: define intradepartmental 
relationships, designate a debris manager, and establish a debris &quot;team&quot;</h2>

<p><strong>Identify teams:</strong> Identify the key players in your organization, by
position, who will have some responsibility for developing and implementing a debris
management program. Identify those who will be on your &quot;Team&quot; and define their
roles accordingly. </p>

<p>Work with the person in your jurisdiction who will be responsible for coordinating the
overall disaster response so that the debris management functions are integrated into the
overall disaster response and recovery. </p>

<p>Coordinate with other &quot;teams,&quot; particularly with whomever is in charge of
communication and information.</p>

<h3><a name="sonea">Debris</a> team: It is important to identify
beforehand all those entities that are needed to coordinate and implement a diversion
program. </h3>

<p>Typically, the Solid Waste Planning Department, Public Works Department, and the Local
Enforcement Agency represent the three areas with the most direct responsibility in: 

<ul>
  <li>establishing diversion programs;</li>
  <li>removing or temporarily storing disaster-related debris; and </li>
  <li>coordinating the enforcement and permitting of solid waste facilities and operations
    respectively. </li>
</ul>

<p>Example: While the <strong>Solid Waste Planning Department</strong> may develop a
debris diversion program, it may be the <strong>Public Works Department</strong> that
writes the contract to implement the program or the <strong>Local Enforcement Agency</strong>
that can provide guidance in establishing a temporary storage or processing site. Unless
there is internal coordination, the diversion program may not be implemented. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Core&quot; team</strong>: The complete listing of those staff who could
be involved in a disaster recovery program are listed in the table on pages 6-9. Of these
staff, some will devote their time solely to debris management programs. Keep in mind that
your core team will be comprised of these staff, but that other staffing will be needed
for the other support functions not directly related to recycling or debris management
programs.</p>

<p><strong>City/County OES</strong>: The city/county Office of Emergency Services (OES)
contact is a critical member of the &quot;Team.&quot; This person could be a member of the
Fire Department, the Sheriff's Department, or the city/county OES office, depending on
your jurisdiction's organization. </p>

<p>Develop a working relationship with this person now as he/she can you help work within
the emergency response system before and after a disaster and also help in developing your
requests for debris management assistance. </p>

<p>More importantly, contact the city/county OES (or emergency services department) to
receive information on Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) training for field,
management, and executive staff who may be involved in emergency response activities.</p>

<p><strong>Define roles</strong>: Each member's role within the group must be established
and reporting relationships made explicit. This is especially important if someone is lead
for staff who would in normal circumstances be subordinate to those supervised.</p>

<p>Assign management responsibilities so that it is clear who is in charge and has the
responsibility for making final decisions. </p>

<p>Assignments and responsibilities should be given before a disaster occurs so that
specific staff members understand their roles and responsibilities beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>Communication</strong>: With a number of teams or groups working independently
yet in concert during the recovery process, it is critical to clearly establish the
responsibility for the coordination and dissemination of information. This is important so
that timely and consistent information is released to the general public, contractors, and
the recovery workers. </p>

<p>There should be one spokesperson who represents the organization and speaks on its
behalf and one office (typically the public information office) through which all
communication is directed. Institute a process whereby information is shared with all
teams directing the disaster recovery. Refer to Chapter 11, Public Information, for more
detail. </p>

<h3><a name="soneb">Mutual aid</a>: If an agency's resources are
overwhelmed by a disaster, it is possible that neighboring jurisdictions can loan staff to
assist in the recovery, provided they are not affected by the disaster. </h3>

<p><strong>EMMA:</strong> <a href="ch1b.htm#endone">[1]</a> The<strong> Emergency Managers
Mutual Aid</strong> (EMMA) program administered by State OES may also be an option. The purpose
of EMMA is to provide professional emergency management personnel in the form of mutual
aid to impacted areas to support disaster operations.</p>
<strong>

<p>Examples</strong>: Solid waste planner to act as technical advisor to assist in establishing
a debris management program.</p>

<p>Public works staff members to assist in implementing debris management program, such as
training field staff in proper procedure of source separation and debris collection to
ensure materials can be recycled or reused. </p>

<p>Financial and accounting staff members to set up tracking/accounting system for
disaster-related costs to ensure FEMA reimbursement.</p>
<strong>

<p>Program structure: </strong>In response to the Northridge Earthquake, the City of Los
Angeles' Department of Public Works implemented an earthquake debris removal program. This
program was led by the Bureau of Engineering, with support from the Bureau of Contract
Administration, which provided field monitoring of contractors, and the Bureau of
Sanitation, Integrated Solid Waste Management Office, which directed the recycling
component.</p>
<strong>

<p>Engineering organization:</strong> Within the Bureau of Engineering, the Northridge
Earthquake Recovery Division was created. Staff from various Divisions within the Bureau
were assigned to the new ad hoc division and assumed responsibilities for different
aspects of the earthquake recovery. After the work was completed, the Division was
subsequently disbanded.</p>
<strong>

<p>Advantages</strong>: This aided in coordinating all earthquake-related activities and
simplified billing for debris-related costs since the City could document that all
activities performed by this Division were earthquake related and therefore reimbursable
by FEMA.</p>
<strong>

<p>Table:</strong> The table below lists by function those departments typically involved in
the overall recovery process. Each department is equally important in the process, since
various functions are dependent upon one another. </p>
<strong>

<p>Source:</strong> This table was modified from the OES Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction
Guidelines for Local Government, Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project,
California OES, 1991, to include solid waste functions.</p>
<strong>

<p>Note</strong>: Disaster debris management activities are but one part of the overall
recovery process. Consequently, it is important to understand the recovery process, how
debris management fits into the bigger picture and relates to the other recovery
functions, and how state and federal assistance should be requested.</p>

<h2><a name="stwo"><strong>Step 2</a>: outline and evaluate potential disaster events and
develop checklists for each likely disaster </strong><a href="ch1b.htm#endtwo">[2]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Agency actions</strong>: Describe the jurisdiction's primary actions for each
identified disaster event. The role of each element of the organization should be
explained briefly. In doing this, it should become clear which other functions are needed
to respond to a disaster and which agency is responsible for those functions. This is the
beginning of the establishment of an emergency organization, or debris team, to deal with
disaster debris.</p>

<p><strong>Checklists: Develop functional checklists for each likely disaster</strong>.
Checklists should be accompanied by a listing of resources, directories, contacts, and
other information essential to responding to disasters. In addition to a jurisdiction's
resources, include a directory of similar resources available from other
local/state/federal agencies <a href="ch1b.htm#endthree">[3]</a>. </p>

<p>Following are some useful checklists to consider: 

<ul>
  <li>Alert lists, including a roster of executive and emergency management staff. Include
    home and office numbers, which should be kept confidential.</li>
  <li>Equipment and supply summaries, including a brief description of type of equipment,
    amount of supplies available, and location.</li>
  <li>Directories of field and regional locations, including personnel assigned and a brief
    listing of available equipment and supplies.</li>
  <li>List of private sector supplies and equipment that can augment or substitute for agency
    resources.</li>
  <li>Media listings including television, radio, print, media, and wire services.</li>
  <li>Any maps, charts, and diagrams of potential use to agency staff during disaster
    response. </li>
</ul>

<p>A good example is a map of major transportation corridors. If these are damaged or
impassable, it is critical to have a contingency plan so that emergency vehicles can
respond on established routes to clear roadways and remove debris. </p>

<p>Also, if the roads to the recycling and/or disposal facilities are blocked, it is
imperative to have contingency routes or facilities available to speed up the disaster
cleanup.</p>

<h2><strong><a name="sthree">Step 3</a></strong>: become familiar with emergency response plans and 
procedures and sems </h2>

<p><strong>Identify role</strong>: Become familiar with emergency response plans and
procedures and plan disaster response accordingly. A county or local Office of Emergency
Services office will most likely be responsible for developing and maintaining the
jurisdiction's emergency response plan and may provide training to the jurisdiction's
staff on emergency response procedures. Contact the local OES staff first to see whether
the local emergency plan addresses debris management and to identify staff
responsibilities. </p>

<p><strong>Emergency operations</strong>: Also become familiar with local responsibilities
for emergency management operations. Your local OES staff may be able to provide training
and exercises in emergency response procedures in accordance with the Standardized
Emergency Management System. </p>

<p><a name="sthreea"></a><strong>Requests for assistance</strong>: The table below shows
how the requests for assistance begin at the local level and go up the chain of command
(in concert with SEMS) to the federal government. The example used below is for a major
area-wide disaster with damage in multiple operational areas (counties). Other scenarios
will vary. <br />

<p><a name="sthreec"><strong>1. Local</a> emergency response plan</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Local level</strong>: The local level of the emergency management system
consists of the emergency management staff of cities and counties. The local Emergency
Operations center field response occurs at this level. </p>

<p>County staff are responsible for unincorporated areas within counties and may also
function as the operational area emergency management staff. Each jurisdiction may act
alone or with other jurisdictions.</p>

<p><strong>Local plans</strong> </p>

<p>Local emergency plans are considered extensions of the California Emergency Plan. Many
jurisdictions have used the Local Government Planning Guidance (formerly known as the
Multi-hazard Functional Planning Guidance) as the basis for their emergency plan.</p>

<p><strong>Local responsibilities</strong> </p>

<p>The Emergency Services Act provides a basis for local emergency management programs.
Local ordinances and resolutions establish local responsibilities for emergency management
operations. </p>

<p>The responsibilities of local jurisdictions are outlined in the table below:</p>

</table>

<p><a name="sthreed"><strong>2. State</a> Emergency Plan</strong> <a href="ch1b.htm#endsix">[6] </a></p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: The State Emergency Plan (SEP) describes the organization,
agencies, and responsibilities of the emergency management system. The SEP identifies
mutual aid resources provided by state, local, and federal agencies, and the private
sector. It also summarizes the emergency responsibilities of state agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Authority</strong>: The California Emergency Services Act (ESA) establishes the
authority for conducting emergency operations following the proclamation of an emergency
by the Governor, or an emergency proclamation by a local jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>State OES</strong>: The Office of Emergency Services (OES) is part of the
Governor's Office and performs executive functions assigned by the Governor. The OES
Director is assisted by representatives from other state agencies. The OES Director
coordinates the emergency activities of all state agencies during a state of war
emergency, a state of emergency, or a local emergency.</p>

<p><a name="sthreee"><strong>3. Federal</a> Response Plan</strong> <a href="ch1b.htm#endseven">[7]</a></p>

<p><strong>Federal level</strong>: When a disaster overwhelms the capabilities of state
and local governments, they may request help from the federal government. The multi-agency
disaster response program that helps states during and after a disaster is the Federal
Response Plan (FRP).</p>

<p><strong>How the FRP works</strong>: The President may provide federal resources to the
affected areas by declaring an emergency or disaster. Once the President has made such a
declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for activating
and implementing the FRP. </p>

<p><strong>Resources</strong>: The Federal Response Plan groups federal assistance into 12
functional areas called Emergency Support Functions or ESFs. These include fire fighting,
transportation, health and medical services, public works, urban search and rescue, and
others. </p>

<p><a name="sthreef"><strong>SEMS</a> Training</strong> <a href="ch1b.htm#endeight">[8]</a></p>

<p><strong>Get trained: Receive training on the standardized emergency management system</strong>.
Those involved in debris management should become an integral part of their jurisdiction's
emergency response system in order to: 

<ul>
  <li>effectively coordinate the debris management response with the overall disaster
    response, </li>
  <li>know how to request assistance through proper channels, and</li>
  <li>obtain reimbursement for eligible disaster costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergency response is now based on the Standardized Emergency Management System
described below. For more information, contact your local OES coordinator or the State OES
Regional Office nearest you (see Attachment A for a listing of offices).</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: As a result of the 1991 East Bay Hills fire in Oakland,
Senate Bill 1841 was passed by the Legislature and regulations subsequently implemented in
9/94 that established the <strong>Standardized Emergency Management System</strong>
(SEMS). The intent of the law was to improve the coordination of state and local emergency
response in California. </p>

<p><strong>Framework</strong>: The framework of SEMS includes: 

<ul>
  <li>the Incident Command System (ICS), </li>
  <li>multi-agency or inter-agency coordination, </li>
  <li>Master Mutual Aid Agreement and system, and</li>
  <li>the operational area concept.</li>
</ul>

<p>ICS is the nationally used standardized emergency management system for field level
response, commonly used by fire and law enforcement.</p>

<p><strong>Must use SEMS</strong>: State agencies are mandated to use SEMS. Local
jurisdictions, including special districts, must use SEMS in responding to emergencies and
disasters in order to be reimbursed for eligible personnel-related costs under state
disaster assistance programs.</p>

<p><a name="sthreeg"><strong>Emergency</a> response procedures</strong> <a href="ch1b.htm#endnine">
[9]</a></p>

<p><strong>Learn system</strong>: Become familiar with your agency's emergency response
procedures and coordinate the disaster debris response accordingly. Typically the
emergency response will be coordinated at the department, city, or regional level. </p>

<p><strong>EOC</strong>: In general, the Emergency Operations center (EOC) is the facility
used to coordinate the overall jurisdictional response and support to an emergency. </p>

<p><strong>DOC</strong>: Is a Department Emergency Operations center which supports the
jurisdiction's EOC and specific field operations. </p>

<p>If a Department Operations center (DOC), or the jurisdiction's Emergency Operations
center (EOC) is activated, determine who from the agency is the designated representative
and coordinate requests for debris management and clearance assistance to the DOC or EOC
through the appropriate channels. </p>

<p><strong>Additional information</strong>: For additional information on disaster
assistance and debris management guidelines, review the<strong> regulations governing
disaster assistance</strong> (Attachment B) and the federal <strong>Debris Removal
Guidelines</strong> (Attachment C).</p>
