    <h2><a name="sectionone">1: </a>Introduction </h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of this chapter is to provide assistance to local
jurisdictions in developing a disaster plan for the collection of household hazardous
wastes (HHW). </p>

<p><strong>Need to modify</strong>: While many local jurisdictions already have
comprehensive collection programs for HHW, these programs may need to be modified to allow
the program to operate adequately during a disaster. A good disaster plan can help meet
these needs. </p>
<strong>

<p>Establish a</strong>&nbsp; <strong>program:</strong> For those jurisdictions that do not have a
comprehensive collection program, Section 5 below provides information on how to establish
a HHW collection program prior to a disaster. </p>

<p><strong>If disaster strikes</strong>: If a disaster occurs prior to establishing a
comprehensive household hazardous waste collection program and/or a disaster plan, local
jurisdictions should follow Section 4 below on &quot;Contents For a HHW Collection Program
Disaster Plan.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Focus is HHW</strong>: While some of the information contained in this chapter
may apply to hazardous materials emergency response, the focus of this chapter is on
household hazardous waste collection programs. </p>

<p>Jurisdictions should contact local emergency agencies, the Governor's Office of
Emergency Services (OES), and the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) for more
specific information on hazardous materials emergency response. </p>

<p><strong>Chapter contents</strong>: This chapter contains five sections.</p>

<h2><a name="sectiontwo">2:</a> Background on household hazardous waste</h2>

<p><strong>What is HHW</strong>? Common household products that contain hazardous
materials become HHW when discarded. Typical HHW include paint, used oil, batteries, and
pesticides. </p>

<p>In California, HHW is not exempt from most hazardous waste laws, and it is illegal to
dispose of HHW in solid waste landfills, down storm drains, and into municipal sewer
systems. </p>

<p>While HHW must be managed as a hazardous waste, some wastes such as latex paint,
batteries, and used oil are recyclable, and local jurisdictions are encouraged to recycle
whenever possible. </p>

<h2>3: <a name="sectionthree">Purpose</a> of disaster planning for household 
hazardous waste </h2>

<p><strong>Minimize impacts</strong>: The purpose of disaster planning for HHW is to
minimize potential public health and safety impacts, as well as to minimize costs and
confusion. </p>

<p><strong>Not prepared</strong>: In past disasters, local jurisdictions across the
country were not adequately prepared for managing the HHW generated by disasters. While
many local jurisdictions in California have already established HHW collection programs,
these programs may need to be modified and expanded to accommodate the effects of a
disaster. </p>

<p><strong>Need for options</strong>: For example, existing transportation routes may not
be accessible to a permanent collection facility, so other options such as roving services
may need to be provided. In addition, wastes that have been collected from past floods
have been uncontainerized, mixed, unknowns, and wetted creating a more complex and
dangerous situation.</p>

<p><strong>Coordinate plan</strong>: For cities that participate in a county collection
program, a disaster plan should be developed in conjunction with the county. In addition,
a disaster plan should be developed in consultation with the following:

<ul>
  <li>local/regional emergency management agencies,</li>
  <li>fire departments,</li>
  <li>police, and</li>
  <li>other local entities that may be involved in disaster and/or HHW collection programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4: <a name="sectionfour">Contents</a> for a household hazardous waste collection program disaster plan 
	</h2>

<p><strong>Plan contents:</strong> The following information should be included in a local
disaster plan for HHW collection. This information may need to be modified or expanded to
meet the individual needs for each local jurisdiction, as well as the disaster incident.</p>
<strong>

<p>Description of existing</strong> <strong>HHW collection</strong> <strong>program</strong>: The disaster plan
should include information about the jurisdiction's existing HHW collection program,
including the contact person(s) and existing HHW collection permits. The plan should
provide detailed information about the following:

<ul>
  <li>type of collection program,</li>
  <li>responsible agency,</li>
  <li>location of facilities,</li>
  <li>hours of operation,</li>
  <li>contact person,</li>
  <li>telephone number,</li>
  <li>storage capacity,</li>
  <li>types of wastes accepted, and</li>
  <li>any other relevant information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Designate HHW coordinator</strong>: The designation of a HHW coordinator should
be made and incorporated into the local incident command system (ICS). </p>

<p>Coordinators should receive training on local and state emergency response planning,
disaster funding procedures, documentation, and any other areas related to the
coordinator's duty checklist. </p>

<p>The coordinator should also be familiar with the Standardized Emergency Management
System (SEMS), and insure that local/regional emergency response personnel are familiar
with and have adopted the plan. </p>

<p>More than one staff person should be trained as a HHW coordinator, as staff may not be
available at the time of a disaster. In addition, the responsibilities for the disaster
may be more than one coordinator can handle. </p>

<p><strong>Develop lists</strong>: The following lists should be developed for use during
a disaster for HHW collection:

<ul>
  <li>A Local Emergency Personnel Contact List of those staff that would be involved in HHW
    collection programs in the event of a disaster.</li>
  <li>Include names, telephone numbers, fax numbers, pager numbers, and roles and
    responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Information on the local incident commander should be included.</li>
  <li>Identification of &quot;who approves what&quot; for expenditures and activities need to
    be included.</li>
  <li>Also, identify those responsible for any necessary local permits.</li>
  <li>Duty Checklists should be developed for those local staff that will have a primary role
    in HHW collection programs. Include chain-of-command reporting procedures.</li>
  <li>A State Emergency Contact List should be developed which includes:</li>
  <li>the local OES area coordinator,</li>
  <li>the Department of Toxic Substances Control,</li>
  <li>and the CIWMB disaster coordinator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these emergency numbers may not be available until the time of the disaster. </p>

<p>While federal agencies may be involved during a disaster, the initial contact for
assistance needs to follow SEMS. After contacting your local OES emergency coordinator, a
contact number may at that time be provided for federal agencies such as FEMA or EPA. </p>

<p><strong>Checklists</strong>: According to staff of the County of Sonoma, California,
checklists were a very useful tool during the County's past flooding disasters. Checklists
are recommended because they provided:

<ul>
  <li>a quick assignment of duties,</li>
  <li>quick reference, and</li>
  <li>back-up documentation if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, see Attachment A, a checklist developed by Sonoma County. </p>

<p><strong>Mutual aid agreements</strong>: It may be useful to develop mutual aid
agreements with other jurisdictions for collection of HHW during a disaster as well as
providing public information. Please refer to Chapter 7 of this Plan for more information
on mutual aid.</p>

<p><strong>Identification of collection sites and equipment</strong>: During past
disasters, sites were in high demand for emergency temporary collection sites for HHW, as
well as for other emergency needs. Due to the high demand for emergency sites, it is
recommended that the local HHW coordinator work closely with local emergency response
personnel in developing a plan for temporary sites to meet all needs.</p>

<p>Identification of both publically and privately-owned equipment that can be used for
disasters and HHW is also important. Examples of needed equipment include trucks and
forklifts.</p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: Refer to Chapter 4 on Temporary Storage Sites for
more information.</p>

<p><strong>Contractors/haulers</strong>: While many jurisdictions already have HHW
contractor/hauler agreements in place, these agreements should address the additional
needs for services due to a disaster. </p>

<p>Back-up contractor/hauler agreements may also need to be in place, since contractors
may be overwhelmed with work during a disaster. In addition, State and federal agencies
may have contractors available through their programs. </p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: Refer to Chapter 5 on Contracts for more
information.</p>

<p><strong>Timing of HHW collection events</strong>: While it is important to have special
collection opportunities&nbsp; for disaster-related HHW as soon as possible to avoid
illegal disposal, having an event or service too soon after a disaster may result in low
participation. </p>

<p>The appropriate time for a special collection event/service will differ, but sufficient
public notification, assessment and monitoring of the disaster and cleanup efforts are
important factors. </p>

<p><strong>Public Information/notification</strong>: Local jurisdictions should be
prepared to provide the public with information related to the problems associated with
HHW along with information about special collection events and services. </p>

<p>It may be helpful to establish a telephone hotline, or modify an existing hotline, for
the public to call for information. If a hotline is not established, or telephone service
is disrupted due to a disaster, alternative methods for notification will need to be
established to distribute information to the public. </p>

<p>Examples of alternatives would be door-to-door notification in affected areas, roadside
signs, and flyers posted in public areas.</p>

<p>In keeping with Office of Emergency Services standard operating procedures, follow the
OES chain of command for information distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Load checking programs</strong>: After past disasters, some residents left
piles of solid and hazardous waste at their curb for pickup. As such, significant amounts
of HHW were collected through load checking programs at landfills and at transfer
stations. </p>

<p>It is recommended that load checking programs be established, and that loads be checked
and hazardous wastes be pulled out. A contractor could sort, identify, package, and ship
the wastes.</p>

<p><strong>State HHW collection permits</strong>: The State Department of Toxic Substances
Control (DTSC) is responsible for issuing necessary state permits for HHW collection
facilities. During a disaster, emergency permits can be issued for special collections
that would not normally be allowed, e.g. curbside collection of nonrecyclables. For more
information on permits, contact the Department of Toxics Substances Control at (510)
540-3894.</p>

<p><strong>State and federal assistance and funds </strong></p>

<p><strong>State OES</strong>: The OES is responsible for requesting assistance on behalf
of local jurisdictions for resources beyond the capability of the jurisdiction. </p>

<p>State assistance may include assistance available from State, federal, or private
sources. If a local jurisdiction is declared a state disaster area, and the local
jurisdiction deems that the needs of the disaster response are beyond its capabilities,
then the local jurisdiction can request assistance and reimbursement of costs from OES. </p>

<p><strong>Follow SEMS</strong>: All requests and emergency responses must be in
accordance with the Standardized Emergency Management System. For information on SEMS,
please refer to Chapter 13. The State Department of Toxic Substances Control may have
funding available for hazardous waste response and collection. </p>

<p><strong>Federal assistance</strong>: If a state disaster area is declared a federal
disaster, then federal funding assistance may be available through the State OES. Funding
and assistance may be available from Federal agencies such as FEMA and the U.S. EPA. </p>

<p><strong>Damage estimates</strong>: The local jurisdiction should provide to the State
OES estimates of damages and a &quot;scope of work requested.&quot; It is recommended that
the local incident commander and/or the HHW coordinator meet ahead of time with local
emergency agencies or State OES contacts regarding the proper procedures and wording of
requests for assistance. </p>

<p><strong>Funding Process</strong>: The funding process may vary depending on the unique
circumstances of the disaster. The process can either be the traditional FEMA
reimbursement process, or by ect assistance from EPA. For the floods of 1996 and 1997,
FEMA, through EPA, provided a HHW contractor for emergency collection programs. </p>

<p><strong>For more info</strong>: Please refer to Chapter 6 for more funding information,
and contact your State OES area coordinator for more specific information. Refer to EPA's
fact sheet, Attachment C.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation of costs and quantities</strong>: It is highly recommended that
all costs of collection programs for a disaster be documented. It is important to account
for all the costs and services of HHW collection programs provided due to a disaster, as
opposed to the existing program. </p>

<p>It is also important to document the quantities and types of waste collected to
demonstrate that the wastes were generated above and beyond existing collection programs.</p>

<p>In addition, it is recommended that local staff contact the State OES area coordinator
for assistance (ideally prior to a disaster) for guidance on documentation and audits.</p>

<h2>5: <a name="sectionfive">Establishing</a> a household hazardous waste collection program 
	</h2>

<p><strong>New program</strong>: If a local jurisdiction does not have an existing or
comprehensive HHW collection program, and does not participate in a county program, then
it is highly advised that a program be established as soon as possible. The following
information can be used to help establish a HHW collection program. </p>

<p><strong>Initial steps</strong>: Following are six steps to follow in establishing a HHW
Collection Program.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">

    <td class="RowHighlight"><strong>ACTION</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td><strong>Define Roles and Responsibilities</strong>.<br />
    Although one person can be the main organizer, the success of the program depends on the
    involvement of a variety of individuals and organizations. Those individuals that will
    have an on-going role in the program should be aware of their responsibilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">2</td>
    <td><strong>Establish a Planning Committee</strong>.<br />
    A core group of people with the expertise needed to plan the HHW collection program should
    be established. Committee members should represent the local solid or hazardous waste
    planning program, local health program, city or county planning commissions, citizen
    groups, and emergency management. Planning for the first collection program should begin
    early, at least 6-18 months in advance of collection program date.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">3</td>
    <td><strong>Establish Goals</strong><br />
    Identify the goals of the HHW collection program. While the overall goal is to keep HHW
    out of landfills, sewers, etc., more specific goals should be adopted to meet the needs of
    the community. These specific goals may be to provide the most convenient service, to
    include multi-family housing, or to maximize reuse and recycling. Establishing specific
    goals will help the planning committee and local officials determine the type of program
    to establish. It is also recommended that evaluation methods and the criteria to be used
    to measure the effectiveness of the program be developed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">4</td>
    <td><strong>Determine Funding Availability</strong>.<br />
    Potential funding sources can be general funds, tipping fees, parcel fees, and grants</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">5</td>
    <td><strong>Decide Who the Program Participants Will Be</strong>. <br />
    Will the program be available to residents only? Will CESQGs be allowed to bring in their
    wastes? (CESQGs are conditionally exempt small quantity generators as defined in Section
    261.5 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td><strong>Gather Information</strong>. <br />
    It is essential that the sponsor and the planning committee learn about federal, state,
    and local laws and regulations that apply to their program. It is also important to
    anticipate the types and quantities of wastes that may be collected through the programs.
    In addition, gather information about other jurisdictions' HHW collection programs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Public involvement</strong>: The public should be made aware of the development
of the HHW collection program as early as possible, and the public should participate in
the development of the program. Bringing in the public as early as possible in the program
development stage will help provide public acceptance and assistance. Residents involved
in the early stages of program development will help assure a sense of
&quot;ownership&quot; and help ensure a greater participation in the program.</p>

<p><strong>Waste acceptance criteria</strong>: The types and sources of wastes need to be
determined early in the process. Wastes such as explosives are usually excluded from HHW
collection programs due to extreme dangers. </p>

<p>In addition, local HHW programs can accept wastes from conditionally exempt small
quantity generators (CESQG) if they choose so. CESQGs are businesses that generate less
than 100 kilograms of waste a month and meet other criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Select Type of HHW Collection Program </strong></p>

<p><strong>Program types</strong>: Various types of collection programs are available, and
the jurisdiction should evaluate their program goals to determine which type(s) of
programs should be established. Costs, size of program, and targeted wastes should also be
considered. </p>

<p>The following is a summary of some of the types of collection programs available.

<ul>
  <li>Temporary (Periodic) HHW Collection Facilities</li>
  <li>Mobile HHW Collection Facility Programs.</li>
  <li>Curbside HHW Collection Programs</li>
  <li>Door-to-Door HHW Collection Programs</li>
  <li>Recycle-Only HHW Collection Facility.</li>
  <li>Permanent HHW Collection Facility.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Temporary (Periodic) HHW Collection Facilities</strong>: These facilities are
generally available as &quot;One or Two Day&quot; collection events or
&quot;Roundups&quot;, and are held at various sites including parking lots, city
maintenance yards, and at landfills. </p>

<p>Criteria in selecting a site should include safety, convenience, size of area,
liability, and local support. </p>

<p>The following requirements apply to temporary HHW collection facilities:

<ul>
  <li>Facilities can only be operated for a period of two consecutive days in any month at the
    same location.</li>
  <li>Upon termination of operations, all equipment, materials, and wastes must be removed
    from the site within 144 hours (Health &amp; Safety Code Section 25218.1).</li>
  <li>Facilities must be operated in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 22,
    Section 66270.60(d)(5).</li>
  <li>Facilities must terminate operations within two days of commencing each session (Health
    &amp; Safety Code 25218.1(l)).</li>
  <li>Facilities operate under a permit by rule issued by the Department of Toxic Substances
    Control. Refer to California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 67450.4.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Appointments</strong>: To alleviate congestion and waiting times for
participants, an appointment-based collection event can be organized. At these events,
participants have appointments at specific times and dates to bring in their HHW.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile HHW Collection Facility Programs</strong>: These programs include mobile
collection facilities that utilize portable structures for collection events.Mobile
collection facilities are set up at different locations throughout the year, and provide a
more convenient service to residents. The following conditions must be met for mobile
facilities:

<ul>
  <li>A mobile collection facility must be operated not more than four times in any one
    calendar year at the same location,</li>
  <li>The facility is operated not more than three consecutive weeks within a two-month period
    at the same location.</li>
  <li>Upon termination of operations, all equipment, materials, and waste are removed from the
    site within 144 hours.</li>
  <li>Contact the Department of Toxic Substances Control for permitting requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Curbside HHW Collection Programs</strong>: These programs provides curbside
service for collection of specific recyclable household hazardous waste, which includes
latex paint, used oil, and small batteries. Most programs collect used oil. These programs
must be operated in accordance with Health and Safety Code Sections 25163 and 25218.1.
Contact the Department of Toxic Substances Control for permitting requirements. </p>

<p><strong>Door-to-Door HHW Collection Programs</strong>: These programs collect HHWs from
individual residences. These programs are generally run on an appointment basis, and can
provide services to those individuals that are housebound and others who cannot travel to
a collection site. Contact the Department of Toxic Substances Control.</p>

<p><strong>Recycle-Only HHW Collection Facility</strong>: These facilities accept only
recyclable materials, and operate in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section
25218.8. </p>

<p>These programs are sometimes referred to as &quot;BOPS&quot; for batteries, oil, and
paint collections. Antifreeze and used oil filters are also accepted at some recycle-only
facilities. </p>

<p>If the facility is operated in accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 25218.8,
then a hazardous waste facilities permit is not required. Contact the Department of Toxic
Substances Control for more specific information. </p>

<p><strong>Permanent HHW Collection Facility</strong>: These facilities are permanent or
semipermanent structures at a fixed location which meets both of the following conditions:

<ul>
  <li>The facility is operated at the same location on a continuous, regular schedule.</li>
  <li>The hazardous waste stored at the facility is removed within one year after collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the Department of Toxic Substances Control for more specific
information about permits and other requirements. </p>

<p>In addition, the CIWMB has a guidance document available for establishing permanent
facilities. Contact the CIWMB to obtain a copy of the guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>Select a contractor/hauler</strong>: Most communities contract with a qualified
hazardous waste firm that handles the HHW collected, and recycles or disposes of the
waste. </p>

<p>Potential contractors should be interviewed, and references should be checked. Other
jurisdictions should be contacted in regard to the performance of their contractors. </p>

<p>In addition, a contractor should be selected based on the needs and program types
selected by the jurisdiction. Contractor roles can range from total operation of HHW
collection programs to only hauling the wastes to a hazardous waste facility.</p>

<p><strong>Develop a site operation plan</strong>: A site needs to be selected and a site
design needs to be developed. The site design should show the placement of equipment and
demonstrate how the program site will operate. Please refer to the Department of Toxic
Substances Control's Inspection Checklist for detailed information. </p>

<p><strong>Develop a health &amp; safety plan</strong>: Well-trained personnel as well as
a site safety plan are crucial to the success of a HHW collection program. Personnel
training will depend on the type of HHW collection program and the job category of each
employee. </p>

<p>A health and safety officer should be part of the HHW collection program staff and be
on site during collection. Health and safety officers should be responsible for proper
personal protection equipment (PPE) and proper safety training. </p>

<p>Refer to Cal/OSHA for specific training requirements. A site safety plan should be
included which provides safety procedures to be followed at a particular site.</p>

<p><strong>Develop an emergency response plan</strong>: An emergency response plan should
be developed&nbsp; for every HHW collection program. This plan should accomplish the
following:

<ul>
  <li>identify the responsible roles of site personnel (including designation of an emergency
    coordinator);</li>
  <li>describe response procedures for different types of emergencies; and</li>
  <li>identify emergency services to be called if necessary.</li>
  <li>Emergency telephone numbers should also be listed at the site, including fire and police
    (911), ambulances, and hospitals.</li>
  <li>Spill reporting numbers should be listed, including local emergency response and
    response contractors.</li>
  <li>In some cases, a spill should be reported to the State Office of Emergency Services at
    (800) 852-7550.</li>
  <li>It may be beneficial to be listed with CHEMTREC (a chemical industry 
  organization). Fee required for this service. Waste transporters/jurisdictions 
  who have a waste profile on file can contact CHEMTREC's emergency number, 
  (800) 424-9300, during an emergency incident, and an Emergency Service 
  Specialist can assist with their needs. Information about this service can be 
  obtained from CHEMTREC Customer Service at (800) 262-8200. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Establish segregation sorting protocols</strong>: Procedures for segregating
collected wastes that are incompatible should be developed. In addition, segregation and
sorting protocols should be established for recyclable HHWs such as batteries, oil, and
latex paint.</p>

<p><strong>Establish reuse/recycling programs</strong>: California's waste management
hierarchy places recycling/reuse above landfilling. As such, all efforts should be made by
local jurisdictions to establish programs that not only collect recyclables but establish
a use for those recyclables. </p>
