<p><strong>Background</strong>: The process to request state and/or federal assistance
after a disaster or emergency is initiated when the local governing body or Governor
submits a formal request to the appropriate state or federal office. </p>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Assistance</strong>: Program and financial assistance will vary depending on:

<ul>
  <li>The type of declaration or proclamation declared, </li>
  <li>Whether the situation constitutes an emergency or a disaster, and</li>
  <li>The assistance required.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Topics:</strong> This chapter has four sections: </p>

<p><strong>*NDAA</strong> - Natural Disaster Assistance Act. Provides financial aid to
local agencies to assist in the permanent restoration of real property, other than
facilities used solely for recreational purposes, when such real property has been damaged
or destroyed by a natural disaster. </p>

<p><strong>Local responsibilities</strong>: In the event of a disaster or local emergency,
the primary responsibility for responding to, recovering from, and mitigating against the
effects of disaster rests with local government.</p>

<p>State and/or federal assistance will be provided <strong>only</strong> when the effects
of the emergency are beyond the capability of local resources to mitigate effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to take</strong>: The following four Steps are required when a local
jurisdiction requests a Governor's Proclamation or a Presidential Declaration.</p>

<p>Note that these Steps above are not <strong>required</strong> for declaring a local
emergency. A local jurisdiction can declare a local emergency whenever it needs the
special powers authorized by its ordinances. </p>

<h3><a name="sone">Step</a> 1: Reconnaissance</h3>

<p>During the reconnaissance stage, local government must assess the situation; location,
extent, and nature of damage. This information is important for determining the urgency
and requirements for deployment of emergency equipment and personnel.</p>

<h3><a name="stwo">Step</a> 2: Situation reports </h3>

<p>Local government will prepare an initial Situation Report , which is a description of
the occurrence and nature and extent of the damage.</p>

<p><strong>Basis for damage assessment</strong>: The Situation Report allows state OES to
coordinate information and data from various affected areas to determine what action(s)
may be necessary. It also provides the basis for damage assessment. </p>

<p>The Situation Report, compiled from reconnaissance information, should be sent to OES
Region Office within <strong>4 hours of occurrence</strong>. Reports should be updated
whenever significant new information is available, but not less than 24 hours after the
initial report.</p>

<h3><a name="sthree">Step 3: Mutual aid</a></h3>

<p>The first response is of necessity by local government. If it is determined that the
emergency is beyond the capability of local forces, mutual aid, as provided under the
Master Mutual Aid Agreement, may then be requested</p>

<p>The Master Mutual Aid Agreement allows local agencies to request voluntary,
supplemental assistance from adjoining neighboring jurisdictions. </p>

<p><strong>Request procedure</strong>: Mutual aid requests should first be addressed to
adjoining cities, then from city to county, and from county to state. <strong>Requests for
additional aid must be made by the county to the OES Region</strong>.</p>

<p>The OES Regional Manager may request aid from other counties and from state agencies
within the Mutual Aid Region.</p>

<p>Mutual Aid becomes mandatory under a Governor's State of Emergency proclamation.</p>

<h3><a name="sfour">Step 4</a>: Local emergency declaration</h3>

<p>Should the situation be beyond the capabilities of the jurisdiction to respond, the
jurisdiction would then declare a local emergency and request assistance from the
operational area and/or the state.</p>

<p><strong>For more information</strong>: Refer to Chapter 7 for additional information on
mutual aid. That chapter also includes information on the Emergency Managers Mutual Aid
(EMMA) program administered by OES.</p>
<h2><a name="sectiontwo">2: Local</a> emergency declaration <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[2]</a></h2>
<p><strong>Declaring a local emergency</strong>: If a local government determines that
effects of the emergency are beyond the capability of local resources to mitigate
effectively, the next Step is to issue a declaration of local emergency. This section
describes the process for declaring a local emergency and the conditions for doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: <em>OES, Disaster Assistance Branch, Federal and State Public
Assistance Program, Subgrantee Briefing</em></p>

<p><strong>Authority</strong>: Government Code Sections 8630-8634.</p>

<p><strong>By whom</strong>: <br />
City Council <br />
Board of Supervisors<br />
Person Authorized by local ordinance</p>

<p><strong>When</strong>: Local Declaration must be made <strong>within 10 days of
occurrence</strong> for jurisdictions to qualify for assistance provided under State
Natural Disaster Assistance Act <strong>and renewed every 14 days</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: For a specific situation, such as flood, fire, storm,
earthquake, epidemic, drought, sudden and severe energy shortage, or other similar
condition;

<ul>
  <li>when there exists a condition of <strong>extreme peril</strong> to the safety of persons
    and property; and,</li>
  <li>when conditions are beyond the effective response capability of local government.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Information</strong> <strong>to include:</strong>A Local Emergency Declaration should include
information pertaining to:

<ul>
  <li>type of disaster</li>
  <li>date(s) of occurrence, and </li>
  <li>area(s) affected.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Request for</strong> <strong>State assistance (financial): </strong><br />
Following the declaration of a local emergency, the concurrence local governing body may:

<ul>
  <li>request the Director of the State OES to concur in their declaration of a local
    emergency and</li>
  <li>to provide assistance under the California Natural Disaster Assistance Act (NDAA). </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Resolution to include:</strong> The resolution adopted by the governing body to request
concurrence in a local emergency should indicate the following:

<ul>
  <li>the nature and date of the emergency, and </li>
  <li>the person designated to receive, process, and coordinate all aid. </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Required:</strong> To assist the State OES Director in evaluating the situation, and in
making a decision on whether or not to concur in the local emergency, the following is
required:

<ul>
  <li>Local Emergency Declaration</li>
  <li>Initial Damage Estimate&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Other considerations:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Provide copies to OES Region and OES Headquarters.</li>
  <li>The local governing board must review the need for continuing the local emergency
    declaration at least every 14 days.</li>
  <li>Termination should be proclaimed at the earliest possible date.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong> <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[3]</a>: It is in the best interests of
each jurisdiction to declare a local emergency, rather than wait to be included in the
county's declaration. In this way, the jurisdiction is authorized to use its additional
powers as listed below:

<ul>
  <li>activate additional powers and authorities as authorized by its ordinances;</li>
  <li>extend liability coverage;</li>
  <li>expand the mutual aid system; and</li>
  <li>required to receive state and/or federal assistance.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="sectionthree"></a>3: State of emergency proclamation <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[4]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Required</strong>: Local Emergency Declaration</p>

<p><strong>State assistance</strong>: When a disaster threatens or occurs, local
authorities take immediate Steps to evacuate citizens, alleviate suffering, and protect
life and property. </p>

<p>If additional help is needed, the Governor may direct execution of the State's
emergency plan, use State Police or the National Guard, or commit other State resources as
the situation demands. </p>

<p><strong>When to request</strong>: A jurisdiction should <strong>request</strong> the
Governor to proclaim a state of emergency within 30 days of the incident (20 days if want
federal assistance) when the governing body of a city, county, or city and county
determine that:</p>

        <ol>
			<li>Emergency conditions are beyond the control of the services,
    personnel, equipment, and facilities of any single county, city, or city and county, 
			<strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>Emergency conditions <strong>require</strong> the combined
    forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>When Governor may proclaim</strong>: The Governor may proclaim a state of
emergency when:

<ul>
  <li>The conditions described above exist, <strong>and either</strong></li>
  <li>Governor is requested to do so by governing authority of a jurisdiction (through Local
    Emergency Declaration), or</li>
  <li>Governor finds that the local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Information</strong> <strong>to include:</strong> Request for a state of emergency proclamation should
include:

<ul>
  <li>Copy of Local Emergency Declaration</li>
  <li>Initial Damage Estimate</li>
  <li>Why State Assistance is Needed</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="sectionfour">4: Presidential</a> declaration of a federal major 
disaster or emergency <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[5]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: The following information is excerpted from <em>A Guide to
Federal Aid in Disasters, FEMA, 4/95</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: In order for the President to declare a federal major
disaster or emergency, the Governor of the requesting state must submit the following:

<ul>
  <li>Local Emergency Declaration</li>
  <li>State of Emergency Proclamation</li>
</ul>

<p>The Governor's written request for federal assistance must also include <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[6]</a>:

<ol>
  <li>Certification of implementation of the State Emergency Plan.</li>
  <li>Description of how the disaster caused needs beyond State/local capabilities.</li>
  <li>A description of State/local resources already committed.</li>
  <li>Preliminary estimates of supplementary Federal assistance needed.</li>
  <li>Certification of compliance with cost-sharing requirements of the Stafford Act.<strong>&nbsp;
    </strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Basis for request</strong>: The situation is of such severity and magnitude
that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local
governments, and</p>

<p>Federal assistance under the Stafford Act is necessary to supplement the efforts and
available resources of the state, affected local governments, disaster relief
organizations, and compensation by insurance.</p>

    determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to
    warrant major disaster assistance under this Act to supplement the efforts and available
    resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating
    the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.&quot;</td>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Local requests for state and federal assistance must be
submitted to the Governor so his staff has enough time to prepare the State's (Governor's)
request for federal assistance before the statutory deadlines.</p>

<p><strong>Major disaster declaration</strong>: A <strong>Major Disaster Declaration</strong>
recommendation by FEMA Regional Director is based on finding of whether or not situation
is beyond capabilities of the state and affected local governments.</p>

<p>FEMA will consider factors such as:

<ul>
  <li>amount and type of damages</li>
  <li>availability of state and local resources</li>
  <li>the extent and type of insurance in effect</li>
  <li>recent disaster history</li>
  <li>past hazard mitigation history, etc.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Emergency Declaration: </strong>An <strong>Emergency Declaration</strong> recommendation by the FEMA
Regional Director will be based on a report which will indicate whether or not federal
emergency assistance is necessary to supplement state and local efforts to save lives,
protect property, or avert the threat of a catastrophe.</p>

<h3><a name="sectionc"></a>C: Request for emergency declaration <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[10]</a> 
</h3>

<p><strong>When</strong>: For events that do not qualify under the definition of a major
disaster, the Governor may request an emergency declaration to provide assistance to:

<ul>
  <li>save lives, </li>
  <li>protect property, </li>
  <li>public health and safety, or </li>
  <li>to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Similar procedures</strong>: The procedures for requesting and declaring an
emergency are similar to those for major disaster declarations.</p>

<p><strong>Information to include</strong>: As with the request for a major disaster
declaration the Governor's request should contain the following specific information:

<ul>
  <li>a description of State and local efforts and resources used to alleviate the situation,
    and</li>
  <li>a description of the type and extent of Federal aid required. <strong>&nbsp;</strong> </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sectiond">D: The</a> declaration and initial operations <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[11]</a></h3>

<p><strong>After Presidential declaration</strong>: The Governor, appropriate Members of
Congress, and Federal departments or agencies are immediately notified.</p>

<p>The director, FEMA, appoints an appropriate FEMA (or other Federal) official as the
Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO). </p>

<p>Concurrently with the President's action, the Associate Director, Resource and
Recovery, based on the Governor's request:

<ul>
  <li>designates the kinds of assistance to be made available, and </li>
  <li>the counties or other political subdivisions that are eligible to receive such
    assistance. &nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FCO responsibilities</strong>: The Federal Coordinating Officer then takes the
following Steps:

<ul>
  <li>Makes an initial appraisal of types of relief most urgently needed</li>
  <li>Coordinates all Federal disaster assistance programs</li>
  <li>Coordinates, with their consent, the efforts of private relief organizations, such as
    the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and Mennonite Disaster Service.</li>
  <li>Establishes a temporary Disaster Field Office (FCO) within the affected area to
    coordinate the disaster relief and recovery effort. <strong>&nbsp;</strong> </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sectione"></a>E: Fema-state agreement <a href="chp14.htm#endnotes">[12]</a></h3>

<p><strong>Content of agreement</strong>: After the President's declaration of a major
disaster or an emergency, the Governor and the appropriate FEMA Regional Director execute
a FEMA-State Agreement. </p>

<p>The Agreement:

<ul>
  <li>prescribes the manner in which Federal aid under the Stafford Act is to be made
    available. </li>
  <li>lists the areas within the State which are eligible for assistance; </li>
  <li>stipulates any division of costs among Federal, State, and local governments; </li>
  <li>specifies the period officially recognized as the duration of the major disaster or
    emergency; and</li>
  <li>contains other conditions of assistance.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Amendment of</strong> <strong>agreement:</strong> If other kinds of assistance are approved on the
basis of further information, or additional jurisdictions are designated eligible for
assistance, the agreement is amended accordingly.</p>
<strong>

<p>Federal/state</strong> <strong>cost share:</strong> The division of costs among Federal, State, and
local governments is a negotiable item. The minimum federal share under the Stafford Act
is 75%. However, depending on the circumstances, the Federal government may assume a
larger percentage of the costs. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: For the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the Federal/State share
was 90%/10%.</p>

<p>The federal/state share is typically 75%/25%, but this varies depending upon the extent
of the disaster as outlined in the FEMA/State Agreement for that declaration. It is based
upon the State's ability to pay the cost share. </p>
<strong>

<p>Example:</strong> Sometimes a threshold dollar amount is used. For example, for eligible
project costs up to $100,000, the cost share may be 75%/25%, but after that it may be
90%/10% or 100 % reimbursed by FEMA.</p>
