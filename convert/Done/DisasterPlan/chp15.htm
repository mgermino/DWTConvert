</ul>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: The Natural Disaster Assistance Act (NDAA) is activated
after:

<ul>
  <li>a local declaration of emergency, </li>
  <li>OES Director's Concurrence with a local declaration,</li>
  <li>Governor's Proclamation of a State Emergency, or </li>
  <li>a Presidential Declaration of a Major Disaster or Emergency. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the NDAA is activated, local government is eligible for certain types of
assistance, depending upon the specific declaration or proclamation issued. This chapter
outlines the types of assistance available and the application procedure for requesting
that assistance.</p>
<strong>

<p>Contents<i>:</i></strong> This chapter consists of three sections.</p>

<p><strong>NDAA activated</strong>: The Natural Disaster Assistance Act is activated after
a local declaration of emergency. Subsequently, the local government may request the
Director of OES to concur in their declaration of a local emergency and to provide
assistance under the California Natural Disaster Assistance Act (NDAA). </p>

<p><strong>Required step</strong>: To be eligible for assistance under NDAA, a local
agency must declare a local emergency within ten (10) days of the actual occurrence of a
natural disaster and the declaration must be acceptable to the Director of the Governor's
Office of Emergency Services ((Director's Concurrence), or the Governor must make a State
of Emergency Proclamation.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: The local government must pass a resolution that
indicates:

<ul>
  <li>the nature and date of the emergency, and </li>
  <li>the person designated to receive, process, and coordinate all aid. </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Note</strong>: The resolution designating an authorized agent is usually separate from the
resolution declaring a local emergency. For example, a county can declare and all eligible
applicants within the county can apply for assistance but each applicant must submit an
Authorized Agent Resolution. </p>
<strong>

<p>Required</strong>: To assist the OES Director in evaluating the situation, and in making a
decision on whether or not to concur in the local emergency, the following is required:

<ul>
  <li>Local Emergency Declaration, and</li>
  <li>Damage Assessment Report.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Eligible applicants:</strong> Applicants eligible to apply for state assistance are:

<ul>
  <li>county governments,</li>
  <li>city governments, and</li>
  <li>special districts within the area declared a local emergency by a county board of
    supervisors. </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>OES letter of</strong> <strong>concurrence</strong>: When a local emergency declaration is been found
to be acceptable to the OES Director, OES forwards a letter of concurrence to the local
agency:

<ul>
  <li>setting forth the beginning and ending dates of the disaster occurrence, and </li>
  <li>providing the necessary forms for filing and application. </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Period of eligibility</strong>: Any damage occurring before or after the dates established
for the disaster period will not be eligible for state assistance.</p>
<strong>

<p>Filing deadline:</strong> All applications for assistance must be filed within 30 days from
the date of the local emergency declaration with the Office of Emergency Services.</p>

<h2><a name="sectiononea">Funding for NDAA program</a></h2>

<p><strong>Funding categories</strong>: The funding categories for the NDAA, or California
Public Assistance Program, are the same categories as those used in the FEMA public
assistance program. The federal and state governments use the same work categories for
funding and tracking disaster- or emergency-related project expenditures:</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Category</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Category A</td>
    <td>Debris Removal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Category B</td>
    <td>Emergency Protective Measures</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Category E</td>
    <td>Buildings and Equipment</td>

    <td>Public Utility Systems</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Category G</td>
    <td>Other (Parks, Recreational Facilities, etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Emergency work</strong>: This is defined as work undertaken to save lives,
protect public health and safety, and to protect property. The two categories that fall
into emergency work are:</p>

<p>Category A - Debris Removal, and<br />
Category B - Emergency Protective Measures.</p>

<p><strong>Cost share</strong>: NDAA funding is implemented as a cost share to federal
funding assistance once the President has declared a major disaster or emergency, or it
may be the only funding available in the event of a Director's Concurrence with a Local
Emergency Declaration or a State of Emergency Proclamation by the Governor. </p>

<p><strong>Funding eligibility</strong>: Funding under NDAA varies depending upon whether
there has been a local emergency declared or whether the Governor has proclaimed a state
of emergency. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There must be at least a Director's Concurrence with a Local
Emergency Declaration for State funding to be made available to local jurisdictions under
NDAA.</p>

<p><strong>Table</strong>: The table below shows funding available with each type of
declaration.</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Type of declaration</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Funding</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Limitations</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Local emergency with a Director's Concurrence</td>
    <td>NDAA funding for a Director's Concurrence with a Local Emergency
    Declaration is limited to costs for permanent restorative work.</td>
    <td>Emergency work or debris clearance are not covered in this case. <p>If
    these types of assistance are needed, the local emergency must be elevated to a Governor's
    proclamation of state emergency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Governor's proclamation of a state of emergency</td>
    <td>Local jurisdictions become eligible for state funding for:<br />
    emergency work, <br />
    debris removal, and <br />
    permanent restoration.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Indirect costs</strong>: There is an administrative allowance for indirect
costs. These include overhead, rent. and utilities. FEMA does not reimburse for these
costs. Instead, FEMA pays an administrative allowance based upon a declining percentage of
the total costs of the eligible work that is added to each approved DSR. </p>

<p>The declining percentage is dependent upon the accumulated dollar amount obligated for
that applicant. For example, it is 3% for the first $100,000 obligated, 2% for the next
$900,000 obligated, 1% for the next $4,000,000 obligated, and 0.5% for accumulated costs
over $5,000,000.</p>

<p><strong>10% rate</strong>: NDAA allows a local agency to apply a flat 10% rate against
eligible direct labor costs, excluding employee benefits, to develop a reimbursable
indirect cost. To receive up to 40%, the agency must prepare an Indirect Cost Rate
Proposal (ICRP), according to OMB Circular A-87. An NDAA applicant must have a current
ICRP at the time of final inspection to recover any rate above the minimum 10% flat
indirect cost rate. </p>

<p><strong>Minimum amounts</strong>: State OES will no longer fund DSRs less than $1000,
or any other DSRs that FEMA declares ineligible. As of September 13, 1996, in a
Presidential declared disaster, OES will only pay the State's portion of the non-federal
share of costs deemed eligible for funding by FEMA (refer to attached memo from Richard
Andrews, Director, regarding: State Funding for Public Assistance Projects, Attachment B).</p>

<p>The accumulative State share for an applicant has to total $2,500 at a minimum before
that applicant can receive any state funding. </p>

<p><strong>What to file</strong>: There is no need for local government to apply for the
state program separately if federal funding is requested. </p>

<p>If it is a state-only disaster, then the jurisdiction will have to file an application
because state funding will be the only funding available.</p>

<h2><a name="sectiononeb">Cost</a> Share</h2>

<p><strong>Local share</strong>:&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>FEMA pays a minimum of 75% of the eligible disaster-related costs. </li>
  <li>State OES generally pays up to 75% of the remaining 25% (of the non-federal share).</li>
  <li>Local government is responsible for 25% of the non-federal share, or 6.5% of total
    eligible costs. However, this 6.5% can be less, depending upon the circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Federal share:</strong> NDAA funding is implemented as a cost share to federal funding
assistance once the President has declared a major disaster or emergency. </p>

<p>The State will pay up to 100% of the 25% non-federal share where there is a legislative
enactment indicating such intent (i.e., as with the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, 1991 East
Bay Fire, and 1994 Northridge Earthquake).</p>

<p>State agencies and private non-profits receive no funding under the NDAA.</p>

<h2><a name="sectiononec">Withhold</a> or retention</h2>

<p><strong>Federal withhold</strong>: In general, OES withholds 25% of the federal share
until final inspection for state agencies and private non-profits; 10% of the federal
share for cities and counties. However, there are exceptions for reduced withholdings.</p>

<p>Local government can request a partial inspection to close out the project and receive
the withhold.</p>

<p><strong>State retention</strong>: There is 10% retention of the State share.</p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: For more specific information and forms to complete
to apply for state assistance through the Natural Disaster Assistance Act (NDAA), refer to
the Applicant's Briefing Packet for Local Governments and Special Districts available from
the Disaster Assistance Division of the Office of Emergency Services.</p>

<h2><a name="sectiontwo">2: Assistance</a> available with a governor's 
proclamation of a state of emergency <a href="chp15.htm#endnotes">[2]</a> </h2>

<p><strong>State assistance available</strong>: Under a State of Emergency Proclamation,
the Governor has the authority to:

<ul>
  <li>expend budgeted or emergency funds;</li>
  <li>use state resources (i.e, California National Guard, California Conservation Corps,
    CCC); and</li>
  <li>direct all agencies to utilize and employ state personnel, equipment, and facilities to
    avert or alleviate actual or threatened disaster damages.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mutual aid</strong>: Master Mutual Aid Agreement allows local agencies to
request voluntary, supplemental assistance. Mutual aid becomes mandatory under a
Governor's State of Emergency proclamation.</p>

<p><strong>NDAA assistance</strong>: The Natural Disaster Assistance Act provides
financial aid to local agencies to assist in the permanent restoration of public real
property, other than facilities used solely for recreational purposes, when such real
property has been damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: &quot;Natural disaster,&quot; as defined, means a fire,
flood, storm, tidal wave, earthquake or other similar public calamity resulting from
natural causes, which, due to the magnitude of the occurrence, warrants the declaration of
a &quot;Local Emergency&quot; by the governing body of the county or city in which the
disaster has occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Amount of assistance</strong>: The amount of state assistance which may be
received by an eligible applicant is based on a formula in the law to compute the
respective shares of the state and the local agency. </p>
<strong>

<p>Factors</strong>: The formula takes into consideration the following factors in determining
amount of assistance:

<ul>
  <li>estimated cost of eligible work; and </li>
  <li>the local agency's revenues for the prior fiscal year, which is separated into two
    separate types of projects: </li>
  <li>Public Facilities Projects and </li>
  <li>Street and Highway Projects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>E</strong>xamples</p>

<p><strong>State/federal assistance</strong>: Following are some examples of state and
federal assistance after a Governor's proclamation of a state emergency.</p>
