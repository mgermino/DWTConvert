survey reports and in tracking state and federal disaster or emergency-related
expenditures.</p>

<p>For management purposes, FEMA has established the following categories of damage:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Emergency Work</strong> = Categories A and B for emergency actions</li>

<p><strong>Emergency work</strong>: Public interest defined as measures <strong>necessary</strong>
to:

  <li>Eliminate or lessen immediate threats to life, public health, or safety, or threats of
    significant additional damage to improved public or private property; or</li>
</ul>

<ul>

disaster, in conformity with current codes and standards.</p>

<p><strong>Administrative costs</strong>: Allowance for necessary costs of requesting,
obtaining, and administering federal disaster assistance sub-grants </p>

<p><strong>Sliding Scale</strong>: The declining percentage for administrative allowance
is based upon the total dollar value of the federal assistance provided (sum of the
federal share of all obligated DSRs).</p>

<h2><a name="stepthree">3: Federal</a> assistance to state and local governments</h2>

<p><strong>Briefings</strong>: OES conducts briefings for state, local, and private
non-profit organizations as soon as practicable after the declaration of a major disaster
or emergency. The purpose is to provide information on the types of assistance available
and the means by which funds are provided. Applications for assistance (Notice of
Interest) are usually accepted at these briefings to expedite the application process.</p>

<p><strong>Inspection team</strong>: Federal/State/local team inspects every damaged site
listed on the applicant's Exhibit B (List of Projects) submitted with the Notice of
Interest.</p>

<p><strong>Damage survey reports</strong>: After inspections by the Federal/State/local
inspection team, the Federal inspector prepares a Damage Survey Report (DSR). The DSR
identifies the project and its location and provides a recommended scope of work and
estimated cost in accordance with FEMA eligibility criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Eligible applicants</strong>: Eligible applicants for assistance are:

<ul>
  <li>State governmental agencies/departments;</li>
  <li>local governments;</li>

<p><strong>Compliance requirements</strong>: The applicant must comply with appropriate
hazard mitigation, environmental protection and floodplain management regulations as a
condition for receiving Federal disaster assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Other forms of assistance</strong>: Other forms of assistance that may be made
available&nbsp; under a Presidential declaration or a major disaster include:

<ul>
  <li>Community disaster loans from FEMA to communities that may suffer a substantial loss of
    tax and other revenues and can demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to
    perform their governmental functions;</li>
  <li>Repairs and operating assistance to public elementary and secondary schools by the
    Department of Education;</li>
  <li>Use of federal equipment, supplies, facilities, personnel, and other resources (other
    than the extension of credit) from various Federal agencies;</li>

    and</li>
  <li>Repairs to projects when authorized by the United States Army Corps of Engineers or the
    Soil Conservation Services.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="stepfour">4: Regulations</a> governing disaster assistance</h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Upon the declaration of a local emergency or a state or
federal disaster, state and federal assistance programs become available to help affected
states and their jurisdictions in the recovery process.</p>

<p><strong>Regulations</strong>: The regulations governing the public, infrastructure, and
individual assistance programs administered by the state and federal governments are
listed below. </p>

<p><strong>Be prepared</strong>: It is a good idea to regularly review updates to these
regulations as they may have an effect on the types of programs funded and the funding
allocated.</p>

<p><strong>Know what you're entitled to</strong>: Know the kinds of assistance your
jurisdiction is&nbsp; entitled to and the conditions for receiving that assistance.
Keeping current with the most recent changes to the regulations can help when developing
the Damage Survey Reports (DSRs) with FEMA. </p>

<p><strong>DSRs</strong>: The DSRs serve as the basis for FEMA and OES reimbursement for
the recovery work to be performed and the costs associated with that work.</p>

    etc. <p>An &quot;incident period&quot; established by FEMA after
    consultation with the Governor's Authorized Representative generally begins at the start
    of the event and lasts as long as necessary to include all normal damages from the event.</p>
    <p>Primarily, damages that occur during the incident period, or are the direct
    result of events that occurred during the incident period, will be considered for
    eligibility. </p>
    <p>In addition, protective measures and other preparation activities performed
    within a reasonable time in advance of the event will also be considered.</p>

    establish the responsibility for reimbursement by the government receiving the assistance.

    <p><strong>Natural streams</strong>: Not normally eligible for assistance. Only
    debris that causes a threat to lives or public health and safety or damage to improved
    property from a 5-year flood event is eligible.</p>

    <p>Hazardous trees within a naturalized area of parks or golf courses that are
