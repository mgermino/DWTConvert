</h2>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: The following information is excerpted from the Reference
Manual of the Debris Management Course (pilot) prepared by the Emergency Management
Institute, National Emergency Training Center, FEMA, pp. 59-65.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong>: Information relative to establishing a diversion program for
building demolition is contained in Chapter 9, Building Demolition Program. </p>

<p>The information below describes the types of demolition work that are eligible for
federal public assistance demolition funding under section 403, Essential Services, of the
Stafford Act. </p>

<p>This section allows for the demolition of unsafe structures that pose an immediate
threat to life, property, and public health and safety.</p>

<p><strong>Four types</strong>: There are four basic types of work that may be eligible
for Public Assistance demolition funding under section 403. They are:</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td><a href="chp16b.htm#subd">Buy-out Program</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The eligible scope of work varies depending on which of these four types the Damage
Survey Report (DSR) classifies the work as. </p>

<p>Check the block under Category &quot;A&quot; Debris Clearance - Structural Demolition
on the Notice of Interest form if the potential exists for demolition of structures for
reasons of health and safety, attractive nuisance, or health hazard.</p>

<p>If the potential demolition is a result of a buy-out program, the buy-out funding
agency notifies FEMA Public Assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The term &quot;applicant&quot; refers to the <strong>jurisdiction</strong>
that is applying for the federal funding. </p>

<p><strong>Process: </strong>

<ol>
  <li>The applicant (jurisdiction) is contacted by a FEMA representative to schedule a site
    inspection.<br />
    <br />
    (The DSR inspection team is normally comprised of a FEMA DSR inspector, a State
    representative, and a representative of the applicant.)<br />
  </li>
  <li>The applicant is asked to provide:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>list of properties to be inspected </li>
    <li>(include owner's name, street address, and the Tax or Parcel identification number),</li>
    <li>map identifying each property,</li>
    <li>local representative to be part of the inspection team, and</li>
    <li>insurance information, if available.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ol start="3.">
  <li>The DSR inspection team does not enter into any structure at the time of the inspection.
    All measurements are taken from the exterior of the structures.</li>
</ol>

<p>The FEMA inspector, in agreement with the State inspector and local representative,
determines if the structure is 50% or more damaged and makes notation of this
determination on the DSR.</p>

<p>The DSR includes all the properties identified by the applicant within a specific
geographical area, such as a subdivision.</p>

<p>If several different geographical areas are identified a separate DSR is written for
each area. The DSRs are compiled to be closed out as one project.</p>

<p><strong>Costs</strong>: <strong>NOTE</strong>: The costs shown on the DSR(s) are only
an estimate because there may be a number of variables included in a demolition project,
such as:

<ul>
  <li>asbestos abatement, </li>
  <li>hazardous materials removal and disposal, </li>
  <li>hauling distances,</li>
  <li>landfill tipping fees, </li>
  <li>third party air monitoring, </li>
  <li>local code requirements pertaining to demolition practices, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>The eligible work identified on the DSR may be accomplished by force account with
      adequate documentation or by contract work.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>When the DSR(s) contain more than one property, the applicant may choose to break up
the demolition work into several demolition packages.</p>

<h3><a name="suba">A: Health</a> and safety</h3>

<p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: The primary responsibility for demolition of unsafe
structures lies with the owner. Most insurance policies have a clause that provides
payment for demolishing houses damaged beyond repair. </p>

<p>The applicant must certify that:

<ul>
  <li>no insurance exists that would pay for the demolition, </li>
  <li>the owner is not capable of paying for such work, and</li>
  <li>there is no opportunity to recoup the cost from the owner. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Condemnation</strong>: If permission for demolition is not provided, the
applicant must follow legal condemnation. The applicant must obtain rights of entry and
hold harmless agreements prior to start of the work. The ownership of the property remains
in the hands of the original owner.</p>

<p><strong>Checklist</strong>: All properties must be reviewed for historic significance,
hazardous materials, endangered species, and other appropriate regulations prior to
Federal funds being provided for the demolition.</p>

<p>The State emergency management division provides each applicant with a demolition
checklist which the applicant must complete and return prior to any actual demolition of
the property.</p>

<p>The checklist provides a partial list of items with which the applicant must comply
prior to demolition. These items include:

<ul>
  <li>verification that the applicant has obtained rights of entry</li>
  <li>hold harmless agreements, and</li>
  <li>investigation of insurance coverages and liens.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Forms:</strong> The applicant will also be provided forms pertaining to requirements for
SHPO, hazardous materials, and endangered species. The applicant must sign and return
these forms indicating he has read them and understands that it is his responsibility to
assure full compliance with all Federal, State and local rules and regulations regarding
the information provided on the form.</p>

<p>The applicant must provide a copy of the bid specifications, final property list, and
bid results prior to demolition.</p>

<p><strong>Authorization</strong>: Once FEMA approves the demolition of properties
identified in the demolition bid, the State emergency management division provides the
applicant with written authorization to proceed with the demolition project.</p>

<p><strong>Eligible work</strong>: Eligible work is limited to the demolition and removal
of structures and other improvements that may represent an immediate threat to public
heath and safety.</p>

<p>Structures that are in danger of collapse are documented on a DSR and recommended as
eligible for demolition.</p>

<p>Other eligible scope of work may include cleaning septic tanks, backfilling basements,
capping wells, cleaning up debris, and any other items that may represent an immediate
threat to public health and safety.</p>

<p>Items such as slabs on grade, driveways, fences, structurally sound buildings, etc.,
are not eligible under the public health and safety category.</p>

<p><strong>Project completion</strong>: At the completion of the project, the State
notifies FEMA that the applicant's demolition has been completed. A joint FEMA/State team
inspects the applicant's demolition sites to assure full compliance with the scope of work
identified in the DSR.</p>

<p>Eligible costs may include any cost incurred by the applicant to complete the scope of
work identified on the DSR. </p>

<p>Every property must be reviewed by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) prior
to any demolition. Costs associated with the applicant's obtaining SHPO clearance may be
eligible for FEMA PA demolition funding.</p>

<p>Each structure must be inspected for hazardous materials prior to actual demolition of
the structure. Costs associated with asbestos inspections, asbestos abatement, third party
air monitoring, etc., may be eligible for FEMA PA demolition funding.</p>

<h3><a name="subb">B: Attractive</a> nuisance</h3>

<p><strong>Eligible work</strong>: Eligible work under this category is limited to closing
openings around the perimeter of the structure to prevent entrance into the structure and
may include fencing where necessary. To secure the structures from access, the FEMA DSR
inspector can provide funding for materials (plywood, fencing, etc.) and labor through the
DSR process. This finding meets the required need to protect life and safety.</p>

<p>This type of work for securing structures does not apply to properties acquired through
an eligible buy-out program. Eligible FEMA public assistance for these properties is for
demolition of the structures and other improvements.</p>

<h3><a name="subc">C: Health</a> Hazard</h3>

<p><strong>Cleaning</strong>: If a building is structurally sound but has not been cleared
of household debris, food, and other items that represent a health hazard, the scope of
work on the DSR may include the cost of cleaning and removing such items.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility for this cleanup lies with the owner. The applicant must
certify that:

<ul>
  <li>no insurance exists that would pay for such work;</li>
  <li>the owner is not capable of paying for such work, and</li>
  <li>there is no opportunity to recoup the cost from the owner. </li>
</ul>

<p>The applicant must obtain rights of entry and hold harmless agreements prior to start
of the work.</p>

<h3><a name="subd">D: Buy</a>-Out Program</h3>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The intent of an eligible buy-out program is to remove
structures and other improvements on acquired properties from harm's way, thus eliminating
the need for future Federal assistance. </p>

<p><strong>Scope of work</strong>: The eligible scope of work for FEMA PA demolition
funding under a buy-out program includes demolition and removal of all structures and
other improvements on the property acquired.</p>

<p><strong>Eligible properties</strong>: Properties that are abandoned as a result of an
eligible hazard mitigation program may qualify as actual or potential sources of
endangerment to the public. </p>

<p>All structures and other improvements are to be completely removed from the surface of
the acquired property in order for the property to be returned to its natural state.</p>

<p><strong>Source of funding</strong>: The buy-out funding source for an eligible hazard
mitigation program would normally be through FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program section
404 of the Stafford Act or through Community Development Block Grant funding.</p>

<p><strong>Ineligible funding</strong></p>

<p>Funding sources such as urban development funding, private funding, National Flood
Insurance Program 1362 funding, or any other funding used to acquire the properties are
not eligible for FEMA PA demolition funding.</p>

<p><strong>Costs</strong>: Eligible costs may include any cost incurred by the applicant
to complete the scope of work identified on the DSR(s). Necessary costs of requesting,
obtaining, and administering the demolition program are covered by the Subgrantee
Administrative Allowance.</p>

<p><strong>Ineligible costs</strong>: Title search costs, closing costs, etc. are not
eligible for FEMA PA demolition funding. These are costs associated with the acquisition
of the property and are the responsibility of the buy-out funding source. Any costs
associated with obtaining SHPO clearance on the properties is not eligible.</p>

<p>Costs associated with removal of contaminated soil, large quantities of hazardous
materials, etc., are not eligible costs. These costs are the responsibility of the
original owner. Removal of public streets, curbs, gutters, etc., are not eligible.</p>

<p>Seeding is normally not an eligible cost unless seeding is required to prevent erosion
on a sloped terrain or there is a local code or regulation that requires seeding of
disturbed demolition sites.</p>

<p>Each structure must be inspected for hazardous materials prior to actual demolition of
the structure. Costs associated with asbestos inspections, asbestos abatement, third party
air monitoring etc., may be eligible for FEMA PA demolition funding.</p>

<h2><a name="stepseven">7: Damage</a> assessment and damage survey reports </h2>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: This discussion is excerpted from the <em>San Joaquin Disaster
Recovery Manual, 8/95</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Damage assessments and Damage Survey Reports or DSRs are
the foundation for FEMA/OES reimbursement after a disaster. The DSRs do the following:

<ul>
  <li>provide a description of the damage, </li>
  <li>set forth the scope work, and</li>
  <li>give a cost estimate of the work to be performed. </li>
</ul>

<p>Based upon the damage assessment conducted by the federal/state/local inspection teams,
a DSR is written.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the significance of the damage assessment process and the
development of the DSR so that the &quot;scope of work&quot; adequately reflects the work
needed.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong>: There are five sections.</p>

<h3><a name="subtwoa">A: Damage</a> assessment</h3>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Damage assessment is the systematic process of gathering
early estimates in dollars and descriptions of the location, nature and severity of damage
sustained by the public and private sectors in an emergency or disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Basis for aid</strong>: Damage assessment is the basis for determining the type
and amount of state and federal assistance necessary for recovery. Damage assessment is
NOT eligible for reimbursement; however, safety inspections are eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Public sector</strong>: The public sector category includes damage to public
facilities such as roads, bridges, public buildings, schools, hospitals, non-profit
educational, utility, emergency, medical, and custodial care facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Private sector</strong>: The private sector category includes damage to homes,
businesses, farms, private schools and hospitals, and personal possessions.</p>

<p><a name="subtwob"><strong>B: Types</a> of damage assessment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Initial assessment</strong>: Sometimes called a &quot;window survey,&quot; this
may be conducted by field responders, or other agencies that can give a quick picture of
the incident as they perform other emergency duties.</p>

<p><strong>Safety inspections</strong>: This refers to searches for &quot;life or property
threatening&quot; situations to decide what actions need to be taken to reduce the threat:

<ul>
  <li>search and rescue in buildings,</li>
  <li>water and sewer line leaks, and</li>
  <li>unsafe buildings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Site assessment</strong>: When local damage assessment teams review damage
sites to collect basic information and initial costs of repairs to present to the
Preliminary Damage Assessment teams.</p>

<p><strong>PDA team</strong>: Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDA) are begun as soon as it
is determined that state or federal assistance may be requested. This data is reported to
State OES along with the request for a Gubernatorial Proclamation.</p>

<p><strong>DSR</strong>: After a declaration and submittal of &quot;Exhibit B&quot; List
of Projects, federal and state teams will meet with the local agency to develop an
estimate to repair each site. This cost figure will be used to track the repairs until
completed.</p>

<p><a name="subtwoc">C: Survey</a><strong> team staff</strong></p>

<p><strong>Federal/State team</strong>: Damage surveys are usually conducted by a
Federal/State inspection team. A department representative accompanies the Federal/State
inspection team and is responsible for representing the applicant and assuring that all
damage and needs for assistance are inspected.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum amount</strong>:<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: State OES will no longer fund DSRs less than $1000, or any other
DSR that FEMA declares ineligible. As of September 3, 1996, in a Presidential declared
disaster, OES will only pay the State's portion of the non-federal share of costs deemed
eligible for funding by FEMA (refer to Attachment A, memo from Richard Andrews, Director,
regarding: State Funding for Public Assistance Projects).</p>

<h3><a name="subtwod">D: Signing</a> the DSR</h3>

<p><strong>Who signs</strong>: The County Local Agent (normally OES), is the only
authorized person to sign the Damage Survey Report (DSR) on the Local Representative
signature line. </p>

<p>The County Local Agent will confer with the person who participated on his behalf on
the DSR team. This discussion will determine if the County should concur or not concur
with the findings.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of DSR</strong>: By signing Item 16 of the DSR [90-91], the Federal
representative indicates that from an engineering point of view, the content of the DSR
provides an accurate and reasonable basis for FEMA to make a determination of eligibility
of work and of project costs. </p>

<p><strong>Keep copy</strong>: <br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Get a copy of the DSR for your file. Give photos to team only if
you have a spare, originals are to be released to the team after a &quot;best&quot; copy
has been attempted.</p>

<p><strong>Only estimate:</strong> The DSR, when reviewed, is a recommendation based on an
<em>estimate</em>. It is not approved for FEMA funding until it is included in the project
application which is approved by the Governor's Authorized Representative and by the
Regional Director, or their duly authorized representatives.</p>

<p><strong>Review carefully</strong>: Block 13 of the DSR should be reviewed very
carefully with each local DSR team member to ensure that the description is a true
reflection of what the County deems necessary. </p>

<h3><a name="subtwoe">E: Facilities</a> over 50 years of age and archeological 
sites</h3>

<p><strong>National historic preservation act</strong>: FEMA is responsible for complying
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act by determining for each
property receiving federal funding the eligibility or potential eligibility for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places (identification step). </p>

<p>FEMA is also responsible for assessing the effect of projects on each of the eligible
properties identified (effects step).</p>

<p><strong>Funding denied</strong>: Funding may be denied if FEMA is not given the
opportunity to comply. Inform DSR teams if you know the site has been included on a local,
state, or national register. </p>

<h3><a name="subthreea"></a>A: NEPA Requirements</h3>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State Office of Emergency
Services (OES) are required by federal law to carry out Public Assistance programs in
accordance with all applicable environmental regulations. </p>

<p>This includes all applicable local, state, and Federal laws that apply to the
protection of the environment. FEMA cannot fund projects until the requirements of the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) have been met. </p>

<p>Regulations for implementing NEPA are found in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (Council
on Environmental Quality) Sections 1500-1508. Guidelines for FEMA's handling of NEPA are
found in 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 10.</p>

<h3><a name="subthreeb"></a>B: Preliminary review form </h3>

<p>The inspection team assigned to survey damage at a site will complete a Preliminary
Review form to be included in every Damage Survey Report (DSR) for the site. </p>

<p>The form is based on 44 Code of Federal Regulations 10 which state that certain actions
undertaken by applicants are <em>categorically excluded</em> (CAT X) from further NEPA
review but that Extraordinary Circumstances will make a more extensive NEPA review
necessary. </p>

<h3><a name="subthreec"></a>C: Environmental assessment</h3>

<p>If further review is necessary, FEMA may prepare, with input from other agencies, an
Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement to determine if the proposed
action may have a significant effect on the environment. </p>

<p>Other local, state, and Federal laws may apply to the review process, such as the
Endangered Species Act or the Clean Water Act. FEMA will use the appropriate NEPA document
as a decision-making tool in the project approval process.</p>

<h3><a name="subthreed"></a>D: Denial of funding</h3>

<p>Federal funding may be denied if FEMA cannot comply with NEPA before work begins on a
Disaster Assistance Project which may impact the environment. Applicants are responsible
for proper and timely assistance in this process.</p>

<h3><a name="subthreee"></a>E: Disaster assistance projects</h3>

<p>Disaster Assistance projects are also subject to the requirements of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

<ul>
  <li>Applicants are responsible for conducting their own CEQA documentation through the
    appropriate state or local agency.</li>
  <li>CEQA documentation does not substitute for compliance with NEPA.</li>
  <li>Where both CEQA and NEPA are necessary, an integrated document is encouraged by state
    and federal laws, to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.</li>
  <li>Improved and alternate projects may be subject to NEPA and CEQA review.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="subthreef"></a><strong>F: OES Assistance</strong></p>

<p>The Disaster Assistance Branch of the OES will assist applicants in their environmental
compliance activities. </p>

<p>Applicants requiring assistance with environmental issues should contact the nearest
OES Regional Office.</p>

<h2><a name="stepnine"></a>9: Hazard Mitigation</h2>

<p><strong>Hazard mitigation: </strong><br />
<strong>(Required)</strong>&nbsp; The Regional Director may require cost effective hazard
mitigation measures not required by applicable standards. The cost of these measures is
fully eligible, in accordance with FEMA public assistance funding criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Grant program</strong>: Section 404 of the Stafford Act establishes a Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program to fund state and local post-disaster mitigation measures.</p>

<p><a name="sectiona"></a><strong>A: National Historic Preservation Act</strong></p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The National Historic Preservation Act was established by
Congress in 1966 in order to ensure identification and protection of historic properties. </p>

<p>The Act established the following:

<ul>
  <li>National Register of Historic Places and the criteria for nominating properties for the
    Register, </li>
  <li>the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) as an independent federal
    agency, and</li>
  <li>designation of State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) appointed by the governors
    of each state. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="sectionb"></a><strong>B: Process to follow</strong></p>

<p><strong>Action steps</strong>: Following are the steps to take in determining whether
properties fall into the category of historic properties and whether additional efforts
need to be undertaken with the State Historic Preservation Officer to protect the
properties.</p>

  </tr>

<p><a name="sectionc"></a><strong>C: Types of repairs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Match materials</strong>: Repairs matching existing materials and construction,
and minor replacement of materials with like-kind materials and finishes will, typically,
be considered as having no effect on the historic significance of the property. </p>

<p>Review of these types of repairs are not expected to cause delays to the normal time
period for state and federal funding. Complete or significant demolition and major
improvements or alterations to the historic characteristics of the property may require
review in a third consultation step.</p>

<p><strong>Coordinate review</strong>: The team coordinates review by the California SHPO
and Council and other interested parties and utilizes the consultation process to the
fullest extent practicable to seek ways to reduce or avoid effects on historic properties.
</p>

<p><strong>No resolution</strong>: Where resolution cannot be achieved, FEMA shall seek
and consider the comments of the Council in reaching final decision on the proposed
undertaking.</p>

<p><a name="sectiond"></a><strong>D: Denial of federal funding</strong></p>

<p><strong>Denial</strong>: Federal funding may be denied if FEMA is not given proper
assistance and opportunity to comply with this process prior to initiation of construction
or other actions which impact historic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Inform team</strong>: If the property is already included in a local, state, or
national register of historic properties, districts, or sites, inform the team at the time
the property is inspected. </p>

<p><strong>Direct questions to OES</strong>: Any questions concerning the historic review
process should be directed to OES Disaster Assistance Branch at the 916-464-1005.</p>
