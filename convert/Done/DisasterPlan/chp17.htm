<p><strong>Background</strong>: Three case studies are included in this Plan--the 1991
Oakland Firestorm, and the City of Los Angeles and the City of Santa Clara responses to
the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The case studies examine how each city established
diversion programs to handle the disaster debris generated within their communities and
offer some lessons learned and planning guidelines for future events. </p>

<p>This information is presented in the hope that other jurisdictions can learn from these
cities' experiences and incorporate these suggestions into their own predisaster plans by
maximizing water diversion efforts and utilizing existing resources to the greatest
benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong>: This chapter consists of three case studies documenting
debris management programs instituted after major disasters.</p>

<h2><a name="caseone"></a>Oakland Firestorm Curbside Pickup: October
20, 1991</h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: The firestorm that raced through the Oakland Hills on
October 20, 1991, destroyed vast amounts of property and vegetation. In fact, to date, it
has been recorded as the most expensive fire in history, with the cost of structural
damages estimated at $1.5 billion. A disaster of this magnitude obviously results in an
enormous solid waste disposal problem. The following are some of the issues and
conclusions resulting from the City's efforts to collect the debris from that firestorm.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Response</strong>: The initial concern for the City was removal of the
imminent hazards. The City's primary response to this concern was to provide access to
affected areas and remove imminent hazards and hazardous materials. This included the
removal of burned automobiles, identifying and removing dangerous and unstable structures
and trees, capping exposed sewer and gas lines, installing temporary traffic controls, and
identifying and removing hazardous materials.</p>

<p><strong>Erosion Control</strong>: The next immediate priority for the City was the
prevention of soil erosion and potential landslides. This was a major concern due to the
topography of the Oakland Hills, compounded by the lost vegetation, and the pending wet
season that was quickly approaching.</p>

<p><strong>Local contractors</strong>: To address this concern, the City enlisted the help
of local contractors, the California Conservation Corps, and the East Bay Conservation
Corps to install silt fences and hay bales along the hillside to impede landslide.
Additionally, the entire burn area was targeted for aerial seeding, while other lots were
treated with hydraulic mulching and hydroseeding.</p>

<p>Later in the recovery period, wood recovered was ground up and used as mulch, compost
or topsoil additives. In spite of the significant amounts of rain the area received, no
erosion problems were reported.</p>

<p><strong>Cleanup</strong>: The hazardous and household hazardous wastes were targeted
for removal before the City clean-up could begin. The City contracted with a private firm
to remove visibly obvious household hazardous wastes. Property owners were not charged. </p>

<p><strong>Additional information on household hazardous waste is addressed in Chapter 10,
Household Hazardous Waste Program, of this document.</strong></p>

<p>By December 6, 1991, most of the hazardous materials and unstable structures were
removed, and full-scale clean-up commenced shortly thereafter. The City contracted with
ICF Kaiser Company to clean up the debris. </p>

<p><strong>Master contract</strong>: The City Manager is authorized by emergency ordinance
to take action for the protection of life and property in a disaster. </p>

<p>The City of Oakland used the approach of a master contract whereby one prime contractor
was hired to oversee the overall cleanup operation, supported by a number of
subcontractors. The City began the clean-up in December, 1991; the clean-up was completed
six months later.</p>

<p><strong>Zones</strong>: The affected area was divided into three areas, which were each
serviced by subcontractors. All general fire debris that was disposed of in a landfill was
initially considered hazardous material, under guidelines of the Alameda County Department
of Environmental health. Consequently, the debris had to be kept in dedicated cells away
from the active municipal solid waste disposal areas.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiate with insurers</strong>: The City also instituted an innovative
approach to negotiating payment for cleanup work with FEMA and the major insurers.
Insurance companies, FEMA, and OES are all key players in the disaster recovery process.
It is essential that each agency agree to their respective roles and responsibilities in
handling disasters.</p>

<p>On behalf of the City and residents, the City negotiated with insurance companies and
FEMA for reimbursement of the cleanup costs. The City estimated the clean-up costs based
on the FEMA/City scope of work. The City then presented the insurance companies with an
average clean-up cost per policyholder. The City based the cost estimate on ten kinds of
properties, with categories such as a townhouse, upslope/downslope small house, medium
house, estate, etc. </p>

<p>ICF Kaiser, the prime contractor, prepared estimates for each category; the estimates
were then given to the insurance companies. The insurance companies also prepared their
own estimates. The City proposed to FEMA that the insurance company pay the first 75% of
the cost, and that FEMA pay the difference. </p>

<p>It was subsequently agreed that the insurance company would pay up front one-third of
the cost of clean-up and that the residents would bill the insurance company for the
remainder. </p>

<p><strong>Cleanup costs</strong>: In general terms, two thirds of the clean-up costs were
covered by homeowners' insurance, while one third was covered by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In meeting with the insurance companies, the Insurance
Commissioner had to approve the release of policyholders' names to the City.</p>

<p><strong>Foundation removal</strong>: FEMA paid for the uninsured. Jurisdictions should
note that FEMA does not pay for foundation removal and will deduct foundation work from
the resident's policy. FEMA, however, will pay for the debris company to remove debris
from the homesite.</p>

<p><strong>Material recovery</strong>: Bid specifications for the contractors to remove
the debris stated that the contractor is responsible for removal and transportation of cut
trees to proper recycling or recovery facilities, and that the contractor must segregate
metals, concrete, and other recyclables from nonrecyclable debris at the site of
generation. </p>

<p>In addition, the City provided contractors with the names of Bay Area construction and
demolition waste recyclers, and required contractors to provide weekly load verification
reports to prove that the materials were entering a recycling facility.</p>

<p><strong>Independent clean-up</strong>: Property owners not wishing to participate in
the City sponsored clean-up were given an opportunity to arrange their own clean-up. If
the property owner did not complete the clean-up within a given window of opportunity, the
City would initiate its own clean-up. </p>

<p>Residents were not required to recycle material if they did not participate in the
City's program. Individuals that did not participate in the City's clean-up did, however,
have an incentive to recycle, as a significant cost savings could be achieved when
compared to landfill disposal.</p>

<p><strong>Estimate quantities</strong>: The City was unable to estimate the percentage of
debris that was recyclable, but did compile figures on total tonnages recycled. </p>

<p>The City recycled 10,498 tons of material and collected total of 90,213 tons. </p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong>: The material was broken down into four primary categories: 

<ul>
  <li>metal (3,828 tons), </li>
  <li>wood (2,229 tons), </li>
  <li>concrete and brick (4,441 tons), and </li>
  <li>general debris (80,485 tons). </li>
</ul>

<p>It is estimated that the City removed, prior to the initial response phase of City
clean-up, 2,000 burned automobiles with another 700 trees removed by Pacific Gas and
Electric. </p>

<p><strong>Materials generated</strong>: The uses and markets for the materials generated
are described below: 

<ul>
  <li>The majority of scrap metal was shredded locally and sold to steel mills and smelters. </li>
  <li>The concrete and brick was crushed and reused in road base material (for more
    information see Attachment A, fact sheet on Recycled Aggregate). </li>
  <li>Approximately 5,835 cubic yards of brick remained on burned lots to be reused and did
    not count in the disposal or recycled tonnages. </li>
  <li>Much of the wood that was recovered is being stored waiting for a market. Approximately
    one third of the recovered wood was used for biofuel. It is estimated that half the wood
    recovered was ground up and used as mulch or compost with the burned parts being converted
    to topsoil additives.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="casetwo"></a>City of Los Angeles Curbside Pickup Program
Following 1994 Northridge Earthquake </h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: The City of Los Angeles chose to address the issue of
collection and processing of earthquake debris through private contractors. The City
determined that it was most effective to use the existing expertise of established
businesses in the area to address debris collection and processing. The anticipated result
would be a shorter learning curve for waste handling and a potential expansion of
permanent facilities to process mixed and segregated wastes after cleanup activities were
completed.</p>

<h3><strong>Recycling Program</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>: The City of Los Angeles developed a Demolition and Debris
Removal Program to handle the debris generated from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The
purpose of the program was to collect residence curbside earthquake debris, and demolish
400+ damaged buildings. </p>

<p>The City collected 2,880,000 tons, and recycled 1,629,800 tons for a 56.5% recycling
rate. The City saved approximately 6,350,000 cubic yards of landfill space through its
recycling and demolition programs (1,629,800 tons).</p>

<p><strong>Reimbursement</strong>: The City explored reimbursement for landfill space
replacement costs. FEMA denied the City's request, stating that the City had too many
disposal options available, including privately owned and operated facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Recycling option</strong>: The City presented a recycling option to FEMA. FEMA
also denied this proposal, stating that reimbursement is for &quot;least cost
alternatives.&quot; FEMA cited the fact that the City did not have a debris recycling
disaster plan; further, upon an initial comparison, the recycling tipping fee was more
expensive than the disposal fee.</p>

<p><strong>Convince FEMA</strong>: As a result, City staff was forced to prove that
recycling should be allowed under the FEMA program. The City explained to FEMA that
California law, AB 939, requires jurisdictions to reduce tonnage going to landfills. The
City also noted that the recycling program was the most immediate and effective
alternative for reducing the impact to landfills.</p>

<p>Based upon FEMA's practice of honoring local policies, the City of Los Angeles' policy
of maximizing diversion in accordance with AB 939 and demonstrating the future impact to
landfills' capacity satisfied this requirement. </p>

<p><strong>Cost benefits</strong>: The debris transported outside the area translated to a
cost/ton ratio increase. In addition, the debris transfer via railroad would require
construction of a transfer station and would increase the cost/ton ratio.</p>

<p>Other factors in support of the recycling program were that the additional hauling
expense, which added up to a two-hour wait at the landfill, was more costly than a
45-minute wait at the recycling facility. At $65 an hour cost increase, the tip fee was
not the bottom line expense.</p>

<p><strong>Letters of support</strong>: The City also provided letters to FEMA from the
U.S. EPA and the CIWMB, which endorsed recycling activities and concurred with federal and
state regulations/policies (see Attachment A).</p>

<p><strong>FEMA/OES program</strong>: FEMA reimburses program costs; they do not give <strong>reimbursement</strong>
advances. </p>

<p>FEMA only pays overtime costs for force account personnel performing emergency work
(debris removal). FEMA, however, will pay ALL eligible costs for contracted labor.</p>

<h3>Curbside Program Setup</h3>

<p><strong>Pilot program</strong>: The City initially conducted a pilot recycling program
using three City contractors collecting debris at curbside to evaluate the potential for
recycling and estimate disposal costs. </p>

<p>Due to the success of the pilot program, the City initiated a full-scale curbside
pickup program using 30 to 50 contractors that were under contract to the City at any one
time to collect earthquake debris at curbside. The City also maintained contracts with
recycling facilities and landfills to ensure the debris reached the appropriate facility.</p>

<h3>Program<strong> Implementation</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Facilities</strong>: The City used several processing and disposal facilities
to foster competition which, in turn, would minimize tipping fees and travel time to
facilities accepting both source separated material and mixed waste.</p>

<p><strong>Contracts</strong>: The City awarded contracts to the contractors based on
access to specific machinery to be used in curbside pickup of debris and the ability to
mobilize quickly when notified of an area that needed removal of debris. </p>

<p><strong>Diversion language</strong>: The contracts included language indicating the
City's desires to maximize recycling and indicating that contractors were expected to
utilize processing and disposal facilities under contract to the City in particular order
of preference in order to achieve that goal. Once baseline disposal and recycling
percentages were established in the pilot program, the City incorporated minimum facility
recycling rates into the contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Order of priority</strong>: The facilities are listed in an order that puts
recycling facilities first. Contractors are permitted to go to disposal facilities when
recycling facilities are closed, temporarily over capacity, or have waiting times which
would inhibit efficiency of collection operations.</p>

<p><strong>Authorization letters</strong>: The City developed authorization letters that
the haulers used in lieu of paying the tipping fee at disposal and recycling facilities.
The authorization letter allowed the facility to bill the City directly and benefited the
hauler who did not have to pay the fee and wait for reimbursement from the City. It also
ensured that the contractors would use recycling facilities, since there was no cost to
them (Attachment B).</p>

<p><strong>Media campaign</strong>: The City notified residents of the curbside program
through a media campaign that encouraged separation of wastes and segregation of household
hazardous wastes. The City would scout areas to maximize the effort of the collection
crews in attempts to fill the capacity of a truck with a single waste material. This
encouraged recycling and transport to source separated recycling centers at a lower
facility cost.</p>

<h3>Lessons<strong> Learned</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: The City, and subsequently the State, gained valuable
experience from the cleanup of the Northridge earthquake. A great deal of material was
recycled and many of the programs implemented during the cleanup will remain as permanent
recycling facilities that will help the City achieve waste diversion mandates established
in Assembly Bill 939.</p>

<p>As with any program of this magnitude, along with the successes, there are aspects of
the program that would be approached differently if the opportunity presented itself
again. In other words - lessons learned. </p>

<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>: The following are some of the lessons learned by the
City of Los Angeles, which are excerpts from correspondence with City staff and
documentation compiled during the cleanup: 

<ol>
  <li><strong>Disaster plan must be flexible. </strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Revise plan</strong></p>

<p>The City indicated that any plan, no matter how well thought out, must be amended at
some point in the process. Therefore, those who implement the cleanup must periodically
review the operation and be willing to address shortcomings or unforeseen changes in
either scope or implementation. Planning is imperative, but no one can anticipate all
possible scenarios in addressing a disaster cleanup. 

<ol start="2.">
  <li><strong>Scout neighborhoods. </strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Locate debris</strong></p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles stressed that it is extremely important to identify the types
and locations of debris piled up in the streets prior to dispatching crews to collect it. </p>

<p>This allows for: 

<ul>
  <li>consolidation of similar types of debris (i.e. wood, aggregate, metal, wallboard,
    insulation), so that </li>
  <li>full loads of like material can be brought to source separated processing stations, thus
  </li>
  <li>minimizing transportation and disposal costs and increasing the likelihood that the
    materials will be recycled. </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Debris identification </p>
</strong>

<p>Debris identification can be accomplished in various ways. In hilly areas, the City of
Los Angeles scoped the neighborhoods using City staff contractors and marking types of
materials and locations on a map. Some contractors will do this prior to dispatching
crews, but not necessarily. This is probably something that should be negotiated in the
contract. </p>

<p>Although the City of Los Angeles chose to blanket the neighborhoods with mobile crews,
a Geographic Information System could also be used for identifying locations. Regardless
of the method, the primary goal is to maximize capacity of the cleanup crews while
collecting as much similar types of debris as possible.<strong> 

<ol start="3.">
  <li>Notify residents of program. </li>
</ol>

<p>Get the word out</p>
</strong>

<p>This point may seem obvious, but there are several potential barriers to disseminating
information on a curbside pickup program. A City's public outreach program should evaluate
all forms of media including: newspaper ads, radio public service announcements, and
television public access stations. Be aware of communities where multiple language ads
will be necessary. Also, be prepared to pay for the ads. The City of Los Angeles was
quoted a price of $16,000.00 for a quarter-page ad in the <i>L.A. Times</i>. <strong>

<ol start="4.">
  <li>Consider only collecting source separated material at the curb. </li>
</ol>

<p>Source separate</p>
</strong>

<p>Although the City of Los Angeles did not institute this requirement in its curbside
pickup program, staff indicated that source separation is something they would require in
future disaster cleanups. </p>

<p>The City of Santa Clara imposed this requirement during cleanup of its earthquake
debris and made it work. This would require extensive notification that only source
separated material would be collected for free. </p>
<strong>

<p>Reduce costs</p>
</strong>

<p>Mixed material could be tagged, and if not removed by the owner within a given time
period, be collected for a fee. This could significantly reduce disposal costs, as the
majority of materials could go to source separated processing facilities.<strong> </strong>

<ol start="5.">
  <strong>
  <li>Institute incentive for haulers </li>
  </strong>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Educate haulers</p>
</strong>

<p>City staff indicated that one of the most difficult aspects of the program was both
educating the haulers on the preferable sites to haul the material to and then ensuring
that they followed through on the instructions. As indicated above, the City placed
recycling facilities in higher preference to mixed disposal facilities. However, the
recycling facilities may not be the most preferable facility in the hauler's mind. </p>
<strong>

<p>Basis for choosing</p>
</strong>

<p>The hauler may choose a facility based on distance, familiarity, or absence of truck
scales on route rather than recyclability of material or disposal cost, as the City bore
the brunt of these costs. </p>
<strong>

<p>Training</p>
</strong>

<p>The City developed a training guide entitled <i>Northridge Earthquake Recycling
Requirements for C-21 Contractors</i>, which lists the City's requirements, materials
specifications, and recycling and disposal facilities. All haulers were given the manual
and trained on program guidelines. </p>

<p>Even with the training, the City needed to constantly police the haulers to verify that
the loads were taken to the preferred locations. </p>
<strong>

<p>Primary site</strong> </p>

<p>An attempt was made to designate a primary disposal/recycle location on a ticket to be
presented to the facility operator. If the load was rejected, or the facility was full,
the ticket would be stamped at the facility and the load was to be taken to the next
facility listed. This was only partially successful. </p>

<p>In some cases the drivers changed the location listed on the tickets avoiding the
hierarchy altogether. This process is also very resource intensive as inspectors are
needed at each cleanup site prior to hauling to mark the tickets. </p>
<strong>

<p>Incentive program</strong> </p>

<p>In conclusion, the City felt the method that had the most potential for success in
ensuring that the high priority facilities (recycling) were visited first, involved some
sort of incentive program. If the drivers received some sort of perk for adhering to the
criteria, more material would be recycled and a great deal of money would be saved in the
form of reduced tipping fees and reduced staff time dedicated towards policing cleanup
crews and haulers.<strong> 

<ol start="6.">
  <li>Continual oversight by inspectors is needed. </li>
</ol>

<p>Oversight </p>
</strong>

<p>As discussed in the previous item, oversight is needed to ensure that the hauler goes
to the preferred facility. Additional oversight is needed for the crews loading the debris
to ensure that material separation techniques are used. </p>
<strong>

<p>Inspectors</p>
</strong>

<p>Inspectors, or incentive programs, are needed to ensure that full loads are taken to
the processing facilities rather than half empty trucks. Under the current system, there
is no incentive for a hauler to completely fill a truck before going to the
disposal/recovery facility. The haulers are paid for their time rather than by weight. The
City felt this was necessary; otherwise, there would be no incentive to haul low density
materials such as wood and insulation.<strong>

</ol>

<p>Documentation</p>

<p>This is extremely important if a jurisdiction anticipates reimbursement from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Comprehensive documentation of all
expenditures related to addressing a disaster is necessary for reimbursement through FEMA.<strong>

</ol>

<p>Contamination</p>
</strong>

<p>The City of Los Angeles initially collected waste, as is, at the curbside.
Unfortunately, a small amount of contamination, such as wood in a pile of concrete rubble,
would require the entire load to go to a mixed waste disposal facility or recycling
facility. The resulting tip fee would be considerably more than that at a segregated
processing facility. </p>

<p>The City then began using crews to pick through piles of debris that had slight
commingling of waste to produce individual piles of separated waste that could be hauled
to source separated facilities at a reduced disposal cost. </p>

<p>Any jurisdiction that is considering using this type of labor should investigate the
potential use of crews from the California Conservation Corps (CCC) or the Employment
Development Department (EDD).<strong> 

<ol start="9.">
  <li>Plan ahead and secure funds. </li>
</ol>

<p>Pre-planning</p>
</strong>

<p>The most important part of a successful curbside collection program is preplanning.
Planning is necessary if the program is to be implemented in a timely manner, and funding
is necessary if it is to be implemented at all. Even if the program is eligible for
reimbursement from a federal program such as FEMA, the FEMA reimbursement will not occur
immediately. There needs to be some sort of funding mechanism in place until reimbursement
occurs. </p>

<h2><a name="casethree"></a>City of Santa Clarita 1994 Northridge
Earthquake Response</h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: The following case study highlights some of the actions
taken in the area of waste diversion by the City of Santa Clarita in its efforts to clean
up after the Northridge Earthquake. The City of Santa Clarita is located 35 miles
northwest of Los Angeles and has a population of 140,000. The City is located 12 miles
from the epicenter of the Northridge quake, which struck on January 17, 1994. </p>

<p>Following that disaster, the City implemented a program designed to expedite the
cleanup of rubble and to maximize reuse and diversion of the debris resulting from
construction and demolition activities that resulted from the earthquake.</p>

<p><strong>Damage</strong>: The Northridge earthquake, and the following aftershocks,
resulted in damages estimated at $300 million citywide. The City compiled data through
December 31, 1994, and estimated that it provided free removal and recycling of more than
250,000 tons of earthquake debris, which resulted in a 97% recycling rate. The City
expected to be dealing with debris, including that generated from rebuilding, through
1996. </p>

<p><strong>Recycling program</strong>: The City was able to develop and implement an
extremely efficient debris recycling program considering that there was no disaster debris
management plan in place prior to the earthquake. </p>

<p>Due to the overall success of Santa Clarita plan, other jurisdictions should consider
evaluating some of the actions taken by this city and implementing them, in part or as a
whole, into their own debris management plans to minimize the amount of waste that is
ultimately disposed of in local landfills.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p><strong>References</strong>: The following actions taken by the City of Santa Clarita
in response to the Northridge earthquake<font FACE="Arial"> </font>were<font FACE="Arial">
</font>compiled from information contained in the <em>City of Santa Clarita Disaster
Debris Recycling Reference Guide, Northridge Earthquake, January 17, 1994</em> and from
information obtained from a conversation with Hazel Joanes, Solid Waste<font FACE="Arial">
</font>Coordinator for the City of Santa Clarita.</p>

<p><strong>3 phases</strong>: The debris resulting from the January 17, 1994, earthquake
was generated in three distinct phases. </p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Phase</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Cleanup activities</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The first phase took the form of mixed debris, which included everything
    from demolished structures to putrescible waste. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>The second phase consisted primarily of demolition material from
    residents clearing their properties of damaged structures. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>The final phase, which may continue for some time, consists of the waste
    generated from the new construction and remodeling as residents rebuild, fix, and/or
    upgrade structures damaged from the earthquake. </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Delays</strong>: The renovation and rebuilding phase in any large scale
disaster can be delayed beyond what is normally anticipated. This can be due, at least in
part, to the following: 

<ul>
  <li>delays in payments to homeowners from FEMA disaster assistance;</li>
  <li>delays in payments on insurance claim benefits; </li>
  <li>inability of regional contractors to keep up with the large volume of work needed; and</li>
  <li>general economic conditions (during times of high unemployment or lowered property
    values, property owners are unable or unwilling to go into debt to finance repairs).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Putrescibles</strong>: Immediately following the earthquake, the City needed to
clear avenues and remove mixed waste, which included putrescible material, to help restore
the infrastructure and protect health and safety. The urgency of these needs compounded by
the composition of the waste precluded the City from recovering much of this material.</p>

<p><strong>Disposal sites</strong>: Because of the earthquake damage to the freeways, the
City of Santa Clarita was unable to transport waste to its disposal facility. As a result,
on January 25, 1994, the City signed an agreement with Kern County for use of the Bena
Sanitary Landfill for permission to dispose of up to 250 tons per day for up to six
months. </p>

<p>This agreement was necessary because the Kern County Ordinance requires written
authorization from the Board of Supervisors to dispose of out-of-county waste in county
landfills. </p>

<p><strong>Mutual aid</strong>: Mutual aid agreements between nearby jurisdictions for use
of equipment, labor, or disposal capacity in the event of a disaster is worth considering
as part of a disaster preparedness plan.</p>

<p><strong>Diversion activities</strong>: Once the waste that threatened public health and
access was cleared, the City began to address the issue of maximizing waste diversion
efforts. </p>

<p>The City began setting up a temporary resource recovery facility to process the
disaster related debris. </p>

<p><strong>Disaster debris defined</strong>. The City defined disaster related debris as
broken concrete, asphalt, block wall rubble, masonry debris, cinder block, clay brick and
construction metals attached to masonry (rebar), scrap metal and wood wastes. </p>

<p><strong>Program features</strong>: The City's proposed program to collect and divert
the disaster debris had five primary features. They were:</p>

        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>#</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Feature</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>No tipping fees. This would discourage illegal dumping.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Enforcement of illegal dumping prohibition.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Provision of debris diversion information.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Assurance against hazardous materials or contaminated inerts being
    dumped.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>City to assume ownership of material product to ensure reuse.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Ownership of materials</strong>: The City determined these features would
maximize recovery and diversion while maintaining an effective collection effort. It
should be noted that the City did <strong>not</strong> assume ownership of the material
product as proposed in #5. </p>

<p>The City found it more effective to have a contractor assume ownership of the material.
Diversion was achieved because the contractor had recycling mandates written into its
contract with the City. </p>

<p><strong>FEMA reimbursement is reduced by revenues</strong>. The City discovered that
assuming ownership of the products and the subsequent revenues from sale of those
materials would impede reimbursement from federal disaster relief programs. </p>

<p><strong>Contracts</strong>: In contracting for its clean-up services, the City issued
one contract whereby the contractor was responsible for the full range of clean-up
activities--collection, hauling, processing, and marketing of the materials. The
contractor in turn hired subcontractors to handle various aspects of the clean-up
operation. </p>

<p><strong>Temporary storage</strong>: The City then secured a 40-acre site for
stockpiling and processing the disaster debris. This is an excellent consideration if the
land is available. It allows far better recovery and processing of waste. </p>

<p><strong>Permits</strong>: Any jurisdiction considering this option should be aware that
permits may be required for various state agencies including the Water Resources Control
Board, Air Resources Board, and the California Integrated Waste Management Board as well
as any local permits that may apply. </p>

<p><strong>Roll-off containers</strong>: The City established contracts with three local
trash hauling and debris management companies. The City concluded that curbside pickup of
earthquake debris would be the most effective method. The City considered using roll-off
containers as a collection choice, but dismissed it due to the following reasons: 

<ul>
  <li>In order to achieve a high level of service, it would require a roll-off box on every
    corner. It is doubtful that any company could supply this.</li>
  <li>Roll-off container use would increase the amount of mixed waste deposited in them. This
    in turn, would reduce the recycling rate.</li>
  <li>Removing waste from the bins presented the potential for extra equipment since loaders
    are needed to get debris to dumping level.</li>
  <li>Roll-off bins represented a potential increased liability.</li>
  <li>The bins also posed a potentially greater traffic hazard, causing blind spots from
    roll-offs at every corner versus occasional piles of debris at the curbside.</li>
  <li>The cost for roll-off bins is potentially more than curbside pickups programs. Beyond
    the initial capital outlay, the City had to consider that FEMA will only reimburse low
    cost bid. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations in developing a debris management plan. </h2>

<p><strong>Evaluation factors:</strong> The following are all considerations that should be
evaluated when a jurisdiction is planning to implement a disaster-related debris
collection and management plan.</p>
<strong>

<p>Labor:</strong> The City was able to obtain labor assistance from the California
Conservation Corps (CCC). This is another area the should be investigated when evaluating
manpower needs. Cities and counties developing disaster debris management plans should
also evaluate the potential to use manpower from the Employment Development Department
(EDD) and neighboring jurisdictions.</p>
<strong>

<p>Public outreach:</strong> Another critical aspect in developing a successful waste diversion
program, regardless of whether it is for disaster debris, involves public outreach. </p>

<p>The City of Santa Clarita notified the public of the curbside pickup program through
numerous press releases. The press releases included information on: 

<ul>
  <li>waste diversion requirements, </li>
  <li>household hazardous wastes, </li>
  <li>materials being collected, </li>
  <li>recycling centers, and </li>
  <li>requirements to separate the materials for free pick up. </li>
</ul>

<p>The City also published newsletters and flyers on specifics and/or modifications to the
program.</p>
<strong>

<p>Material separation:</strong> The City was able to achieve the high recycling rate by
requiring separation of material types at the curb by the residents that wanted the
material hauled for free by the City. </p>

<p>The City notified residents of the: 

<ul>
  <li>materials collected, </li>
  <li>the names of the haulers that were collecting the material, and </li>
  <li>lists of local businesses that were accepting recyclables and items for reuse. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional notifications were made to the public regarding the available assistance of
the CCC in removing block wall rubble and building materials from the curbside and public
right of way and any steps that needed to be taken to keep desired materials. </p>
<strong>

<p>Program extended:</strong> The City of Santa Clarita concluded that debris collection needed
to be extended to address the ongoing demolition, renovation, and construction being
conducted by its residents. On August 22, 1994, the City extended the collection program
through December 15, 1994. </p>
<strong>

<p>Encroachment permit:</strong> The City notified its residents of the extension along with
the requirement that an encroachment permit be obtained prior to placing debris in the
gutter. </p>

<p>The City used the encroachment permits as a mechanism to determine where the various
materials were being placed, as well as a way of notifying residents that free collection
was only provided for those who did not receive FEMA or insurance payments for debris
removal. </p>

<p>When residents applied for permits, they were required to sign a statement that they
had not been reimbursed for any hauling charges. The City stated that some residents sent
in checks to reimburse City for hauling away debris.</p>
<strong>

<p>Successful program:</strong> Overall, the City's program was very successful in recycling
and diverting a high percentage of the debris generated from the Northridge earthquake.
This is particularly true in light of the fact that the City did not have a comprehensive
disaster debris diversion plan in place prior to the earthquake. The City's success can be
attributed, at least in part, to its ability to react quickly and to a high level of
participation and cooperation by its residents. </p>

<h3>Planning Guidelines</h3>

<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>: Although the City's program for diverting waste was a
success, other jurisdictions may not experience this level of success without a
considerable amount of pre-disaster planning. </p>

<p>With that in mind, the following lessons learned from the Santa Clarita case can be
summarized and evaluated by other jurisdictions and potentially incorporated into their
own pre-disaster plans in hopes of maximizing waste diversion efforts and utilizing
existing resources to the greatest benefit. 

<ol>
  <li><strong>Plan for a Disaster</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Successful program:</strong> Although the City of Santa Clarita response to the January 17,
1994, earthquake was more reactive than proactive, it was still quite successful at
diverting a high percentage of the debris generated. </p>

<p>However, most jurisdictions will find that they need to develop a waste management plan
for disaster debris if they hope to recycle a reasonably high percentage of the waste
generated. </p>
<strong>

<p>Benefits</strong>: By recycling and reusing the debris, a local jurisdiction can save
landfill space, help achieve the waste reduction mandate of 50% by the year 2000, and
potentially foster new businesses or expand existing operations in the area that process
construction and demolition debris. </p>

<p>A good disaster debris management plan will anticipate the types of disaster most
likely to occur in the area, and will anticipate the manpower, equipment, processing,
storage, and disposal needs. 

<ol start="2.">
  <li><strong>Assess Processing and Storage Capabilities and Needs&nbsp;</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p>Centralized site: The City of Santa Clarita found that setting up a centralized storage
and processing site greatly enhanced its ability to process and reuse the demolition
debris. </p>

<p>When planning for disaster waste management, jurisdictions should determine if
centralized storage and processing is an option to pursue. If so, a local, adequate site
should be located along with an assessment of the types of permits needed for the site and
contacts of appropriate regulatory agencies that would issue the permits. </p>

<p><strong>Sale of recyclables</strong>: A jurisdiction should also determine if
processing and income from the sale of recyclables will be handled through a contract or
not. Ownership and subsequent income from the sale of recyclable debris may have an effect
on the amount that is reimbursed from federal agencies such as FEMA. This will need to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Local business capabilities</strong>: A good pre-disaster plan will also
document local businesses that either process or have the capabilities to process
construction and demolition debris. </p>

<p>These types of operations could assist in the processing needs for disaster debris, or
gear up to handle the added flow of debris. If successful, a jurisdiction may have new or
larger construction and demolition waste processing and recycling operations established
after the disaster recovery than it had before. 

<ol start="3.">
  <li><strong>Assess Labor and Equipment Needs</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Local jurisdictions will not likely have adequate labor and equipment available to
handle the tasks of collecting the increased waste generated immediately following a
disaster. </p>
<strong>

<p>Mutual aid:</strong> One way to address this need is through a mutual aid agreement with
nearby jurisdictions for manpower and equipment. The drawback to this approach is, if the
disaster is widespread, the adjacent jurisdiction will likely need its own equipment
making it unavailable for others to use. </p>

<p>The City of Santa Clarita was able to employ the assistance of the California
Conservation Corps (CCC). Local jurisdictions should look into employing the resources of
the CCC or the Employment Development Department (EDD) for the immediate labor needs
following a disaster. 

<ol start="4.">
  <li><strong>Determine Debris Collection Method</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Curbside pickup</strong>: The City of Santa Clarita chose to implement curbside
pickup rather than using roll-off bins for the reasons stated above. The City also
implemented a policy requiring separation of materials at the curbside, which greatly
enhanced its ability to recycle the materials. </p>
<strong>

<p>Source separation</strong>: Any jurisdiction considering implementing a free program to pick
up materials should consider requiring material separation at the curb and implementing
some mechanism to enforce it. </p>

<p>The City of Santa Clarita experienced an overall high rate of participation and
compliance from its residents. This may not always be the case, especially in larger
jurisdictions. </p>

<p>To avoid commingling of debris at the curbside, jurisdictions should consider a
mechanism, such as a surcharge, for picking up commingled debris after the initial right
of ways have been cleared.</p>
<strong>

<p>Encroachment permit</strong>: The City of Santa Clarita also required residents to obtain an
encroachment permit before the City removed the debris from the curb. The City found that
the permit process allowed them to track and coordinate pick-up locations as well as
notify residents of any requirements they must meet for the free hauling and disposal
service. 

<ol start="5.">
  <li><strong>Implement Public Outreach</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Participation</strong>: The success of any waste diversion program is determined by the
overall participation of the its local residents. The first step in achieving a high rate
of participation involves notifying the public of the services available, the goals of the
program, and any limitations on the types of materials being collected. </p>

<p>The forms of media used to advertise the program are limited only by the budget
allocated. Consideration should also be given towards providing notification to any large
non-English speaking populations within the jurisdiction. 

<ol start="6.">
  <li><strong>Provide Adequate Funding Mechanism</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Funding delay</strong>: Although many of the costs associated with clean-up following a
disaster may be reimbursed through programs administered by the State or FEMA, there will
be a delay between the time the operation begins and the point that state and federal
funding begins. Local jurisdictions will have to fund the initial clean-up in at least the
short term. A good disaster plan will anticipate this. 

<ol start="7.">
  <li><strong>Document Activities </strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Reimbursement</strong>:<strong> </strong>Documenting both the steps taken to divert disaster debris as
well as tons diverted will serve several purposes. </p>

<p>First and foremost, for FEMA reimbursement, documentation is required to prove that
least cost disposal was used. In some cases, recycling operations will be reimbursed even
if they cost more. However, in such cases, the jurisdiction must document that recycling
the material is required in an ordinance or charter. </p>

<p>Documenting diversion activities will also assist a jurisdiction in meeting the state
mandated waste reduction requirement of 50% by the year 2000. </p>

<p>Finally, documenting the steps taken to divert waste following a disaster will serve as
a chronology of activities, based on the successes or failures, to repeat or avoid in
future disasters. 

<ol start="8.">
  <li><strong>Evaluate the Need to Extend Collection Efforts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Estimate program</strong> <strong>length</strong>: In all disaster debris collection programs, an
initial estimate will need to made on the type and length of services to be provided. As
the collection program progresses, periodic assessments of those initial estimates will
need to be conducted to determine if any significant modifications will need to be made. </p>

<p>The City of Santa Clarita began assessing the need to extend the collection program
around August, 1994. Based on the continued generation of waste from the residents, the
City extended its collection program through December 15, 1994. </p>
<strong>

<p>Program delays</strong>: The City concluded that the continued generation of waste by its
residents could be attributed primarily to delayed rebuilding activities. Many of the
residents delayed upgrading or repairing damaged structures because of delays in payments
from insurance companies or federal assistance. This was compounded by the inability of
local contractors to keep up with the high demand for their services following the
disaster.</p>
<strong>

<p>Rebuilding issues</strong>: Local jurisdictions should consider the inevitable lag in
building activities that may follow any large scale disaster. Insurance company claims and
federal assistance delays will almost certainly increase with the number of residents that
are affected. The same can be said for a given number of established local craftsmen and
contractors. As the market for their services dramatically and instantaneously increases,
the length of time needed to perform the total number of jobs will also increase. </p>
<strong>

<p>Extend program</strong>:<strong> </strong>Although each jurisdiction is different in its size,
markets, and disaster potential, it is worth the time to consider contingencies in a
collection program following a disaster. Plans should be made for potentially extending
the program as well as for changes in the types of waste generated. </p>
<strong>

<p>Wastestream</strong>:<strong> </strong>As the rebuilding process begins, waste streams should vary in
composition and be more segregated. The segregation is a natural result of the phases of
construction, while the composition would depend on the type of building activities
occurring. Beyond actually extending the services, plans should be made to notify the
public of any changes in collection procedures and renotifying residents of the eventual
discontinuation of the collection.</p>
<strong>

<p>Conclusion</strong>: The steps and activities taken by the City of Santa Clarita are only
one example of options used by one jurisdiction. At the very least, other jurisdictions
should evaluate those steps for applicability to potential disasters in their own areas. </p>

<p>Additionally, any actions incorporated into a disaster plan, should be addressed
regionally to minimize overlap and confusion. Even if none of the steps in this case study
is used, the process of planning for a disaster and the waste that will be generated will
reduce the time, money, and efforts needed if that disaster ever occurs.</p>
