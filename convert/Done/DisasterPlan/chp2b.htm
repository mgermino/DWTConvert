	<h2><a name="stepseven">Step</a> 7: identify processing equipment needs</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This step will help you identify the types of equipment you
may need to implement the selected diversion programs and provide some options to consider
when planning these programs. </p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong>:

<ol>
  <li>After selecting the diversion or recycling programs to implement, compile a listing of
    equipment needed to support those programs.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Survey the following to estimate the equipment you can have available in the event of a
    disaster:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>your agency/department, </li>
    <li>franchise hauler, </li>
    <li>private sector, and</li>
    <li>neighboring jurisdictions.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Make a list of equipment needed in addition to what you will have available.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Survey hauler</strong>: Survey your local haulers or franchises to determine
the staffing and equipment they can provide in a disaster. If they do not have equipment
available, they may be able to acquire the equipment when needed. This may necessitate the
jurisdiction writing contracts for debris removal and diversion outside the scope of the
franchise agreement, as the City of Oakland did after the firestorm of 1991. </p>

<p><strong>Survey needs</strong>: It is best to survey your labor and equipment needs
before a disaster. Contact local dealers who can provide the equipment as needed, and make
the appropriate arrangements before a disaster strikes. This includes pre-qualifying
contractors or developing model contracts for debris recycling or removal. </p>

<p>Identify the equipment and labor the jurisdiction has available during a disaster.
Determine the equipment and labor you can borrow from neighboring jurisdictions, keeping
in mind they may also be affected by the disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Lease</strong>: If facilities are not readily available, consider leasing
equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Rural areas</strong>: In rural areas there may be fewer facilities or
facilities that are farther away from the disaster site. In this instance, leasing
equipment may be the cheapest and fastest way to deal with the debris. </p>

<p>Take into account the size of the equipment and the travel distance to bring the
equipment on-site. Consider smaller, mobile equipment in these cases.</p>

<p>Contact local processors or equipment suppliers and manufacturers to estimate the size
of equipment needed. In some cases, the quantity of materials to be processed may be too
small to justify processing them.</p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: For more information, refer to Chapter 3, Debris
Management Programs.</p>

<h2><a name="stepeight">Step</a> 8: review funding options</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Review local funding sources to determine where funds can be
obtained in a disaster to cover diversion and recovery programs until state and federal
reimbursement are received. </p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong>:

<ul>
  <li>Identify local or private funds that can be used to start program until FEMA
    reimbursement is received.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>determine ability to use General Fund; </li>
    <li>evaluate possibility of acquiring a loan; and</li>
    <li>explore use of private funds.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare documentation regarding local policy for diversion/recycling.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE: FEMA may/will not reimburse for donated monies or services.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reimbursement</strong>: To initiate its recovery efforts, a jurisdiction must
be knowledgeable about the state and federal reimbursement programs and the process for
requesting funding. </p>

<p>Anticipate that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) typically reimburses
program costs, not advances them, and that the jurisdiction will need to identify funds to
start-up programs until federal funding becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>Small projects</strong>: FEMA will advance funding for &quot;small
projects,&quot; as contained in individual Damage Survey Reports. For &quot;large
projects,&quot; funding occurs as a reimbursement. Check with OES regarding the dollar
amount associated with each &quot;project&quot; category as this amount is tied to the
Consumer Price Index. </p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Research documentation needed for FEMA, including all
existing local policies, ordinances, debris management plans, etc. for recycling or
diversion. </p>

<p><strong>FEMA policy</strong>: FEMA's policy to date has been to reimburse for the
&quot;least cost&quot; programs, and reimburse for diversion programs if they are in
keeping with an existing policy of the jurisdiction. </p>

<p>However, the jurisdiction must document such policies, provide adequate documentation
to FEMA, and receive their approval prior to implementing the diversion program in order
to receive reimbursement. </p>

<p><strong>Do in advance</strong>: Compiling this information in advance can save valuable
time in receiving approval to proceed with the diversion programs and begin the recovery
process.</p>

<p><strong>Ownership of recyclables</strong>:One of the City of Santa Clarita's goals in
its Northridge earthquake cleanup program was to maintain ownership of the recyclables.
This was to ensure that the disaster debris was diverted. However, the City later changed
its position and assigned ownership of the materials to the contractor, who was
responsible for collecting and marketing the materials. </p>

<p>The City took this action in an effort to avoid conflict with FEMA over reimbursement
for its diversion programs. Had the City retained ownership of the collected materials and
received revenues from their sale, FEMA could have reduced the City's reimbursement for
the diversion program since there was no compelling local program or plan.</p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: Refer to Chapter 6, Reimbursement, for more
information.</p>

<h2><a name="stepnine">Step</a> 9: determine contract needs</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This assessment is critical to ensuring that planned
diversion programs are successful. It will give an indication of the types of contracts
needed and outline the contracting options available to a jurisdiction. </p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong>:

<ul>
  <li>review existing contracts and franchise agreements;</li>
  <li>determine contract needs;</li>
  <li>select contract type;</li>
  <li>develop model contracts;</li>
  <li>develop list of contractors in the area who are qualified and have equipment to handle
    the work and update annually;</li>
  <li>develop list of contractors who can respond in emergency and update annually; and</li>
  <li>pre-qualify contractors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Review existing</strong> <strong>contracts</strong>: Review all existing contracts and
franchise agreements dealing with municipal solid waste, recycling, reuse, etc. Contracts
and franchise agreements are pivotal to ensuring a successful debris management program.
Unless diversion is specified, it is likely the collected debris will be disposed. </p>

<p>After deciding upon a debris management program(s) and having identified funding, the
next step is program implementation. This can be accomplished through contracts for the
debris removal, recycling, etc., ensuring that diversion language is included as a
contract provision. </p>
<strong>

<p>Determine contract</strong> <strong>needs</strong>: Determine the type of contract best
suited<strong> </strong>to the city/county's situation. FEMA recommends three types of contracts
typically used in disaster cleanup. They are:

<ul>
  <li>Time and Material Contract</li>
  <li>Lump Sum Contract</li>
  <li>Unit Price Contract</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alternate bid</strong>: A fourth contract type is the Alternate Bid contract,
which allows the contractor to select an alternate method to perform the work stated in
the contract, within specified parameters. An example of this is the CSU Northridge
cleanup contract for the parking structure that was destroyed in the earthquake. </p>

<p><strong>When to use</strong>: The following table will help in the selection of a
particular contract type, based on whether the work is for short- or long-term services. </p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Contract</th>
    <th>
	Contract Type</th>
    <th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time and Material</td>
    <td>Short-term<br />
    Services for first 100 hours.</td>
    <td>Used immediately after a disaster for emergency life saving activities
    and debris clearance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lump Sum</td>
    <td>Long-term<br />
    Beyond initial 100 hours of recovery.</td>
    <td>Use when scope of work is clearly defined and areas of work specifically
    quantified. Establishes total contract price by a one-bid item. (e.g., demolish and
    recycle 1 structure for $10,000).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unit Price</td>
    <td>Long-term<br />
    Beyond initial 100 hours of recovery.</td>
    <td>Use when scope of work is defined and can be quantified by actual field
    measure (e.g., recycle 10 tons concrete, 7 trees, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Follow procedures</strong>: Check to see if contracting and procurement
provisions are suspended or modified in the event of an emergency or disaster. Be sure to
follow the proper procedures since to circumvent them could jeopardize a jurisdiction's
ability to receive state and federal funding for disaster operations.</p>

<p><strong>Diversion options</strong>: Refer to Chapter 5, Contracts, for more contract
options to ensure that disaster debris is diverted from landfills.</p>

<h2><a name="stepten">Step 10: review mutual aid agreements</a></h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This assessment will identify the type of assistance you can
request from the neighboring cities and counties through mutual aid agreements, and those
agreements that your jurisdiction should consider developing. (Refer to the table on page
36 for a list of existing mutual aid agreements or those under development). </p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong>:

<ul>
  <li>Review existing mutual aid agreements </li>
  <li>Explore possibility of entering into discipline-specific mutual aid agreements, such as
    those for public works, Emergency Managers Mutual Aid, or public information.</li>
  <li>Develop a list of mutual aid agreements the jurisdiction is a signatory to and the
    resources available through each.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mutual aid</strong>: Because California's disaster planning is based on a
statewide system of mutual aid, this will be one of the first options a jurisdiction will
use to get additional staffing and/or equipment.</p>

<p>Each local jurisdiction relies first on its own resources, then calls for assistance:

<ul>
  <li>city to city, </li>
  <li>city to county, </li>
  <li>county to county, and </li>
  <li>county to the regional office of the OES, </li>
  <li>which relays the request to the state.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more detailed information on mutual aid, refer to Chapter 7.</p>

<p><strong>Review agreements</strong>: Review the mutual aid agreements your city or
county is a signatory to and list the types of assistance available through those
agreements. Based on this review, your jurisdiction may identify mutual aid agreements
that it needs to develop, or, for an existing agreement, become a signatory to.</p>

<p><strong>Model agreement</strong>: A Model Mutual Aid Agreement is contained in
Attachment G; a city or county may consider developing such an agreement with neighboring
jurisdictions specifically for debris management.</p>

<p><strong>Public works</strong>: A Public Works Mutual Aid Agreement, which may provide
more specific assistance related to debris management, is under development by the OES
Southern Region; jurisdictions may consider adopting a similar agreement . For more
information, contact the Emergency Operations and Training Officer at the OES Southern
Region, <br />
(310) 795-2900.</p>

<p><strong>Public information</strong>: In addition, a Public Information Mutual Aid Plan
has been adopted by San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties; local
governments may find this useful in developing a similar Plan to obtain resources to
coordinate public outreach and media activities. Contact the nearest OES Regional Office
for more information.</p>

<p><strong>EMMA program</strong>: Also consider the Emergency Managers Mutual Aid (EMMA)
program, which is composed of emergency managers from cities and counties. The State
Office of Emergency Services (OES) maintains mutual aid inventories and facilitates mutual
aid among Operational Areas (counties) and among OES Regions. These emergency managers may
be able to provide technical assistance and advice on debris management programs. Contact
the nearest OES Regional Office for more information (see Attachment H for listing of OES
regional offices). </p>

<h2><a name="stepeleven">Step</a> 11: identify labor needs</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This step will give you an estimate of the types of staffing
you may need and provide some options to consider when planning diversion programs. </p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong>:

<ul>
  <li>Estimate staffing requirements for diversion programs as part of staffing needed for
    overall recovery programs.</li>
  <li>List all possible sources for obtaining additional staffing, within the department as
    well as from other jurisdictions, volunteer groups, and state agencies.</li>
  <li>Enter into mutual aid agreements before disaster for staffing assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: For more information, refer to Chapter 3, Debris
Management Programs.</p>

<h2><a name="steptwelve">Step</a> 12: review local ordinances</h2>


<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This assessment will give an indication of any ordinances
that might affect planned diversion programs, and also alert city/county staff as to any
administrative barriers to securing emergency contracts. </p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong><font FACE="Arial">: </font>

<ul>
  <li>Review all local ordinances to determine the effect of existing ordinances on the
    following:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>establishment of diversion programs;</li>
    <li>establishment of temporary storage areas;</li>
    <li>who has been delegated the authority to act on behalf of the governing body in the event
      of an emergency/disaster.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Outline jurisdiction's local authority with respect to debris management.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who's in charge</strong>: Become familiar with the local ordinances affecting a
city or county's ability and authority to establish a diversion program or to enter into
contracts on behalf of the city/county to manage the disaster debris. </p>

<p>Determine whether the City Council or Board of Supervisors has delegated contracting or
other authority to city managers/staff in the event of an emergency or disaster and the
extent of that authority. Also, evaluate the role of any existing Joint Powers
Agreement/Authority regarding waste management.</p>

<p><strong>Empower staff</strong>: It is important that the city/county staff responsible
for the recovery be empowered by their local governing body to act independently in order
to respond quickly. Having the flexibility to make independent decisions quickly can
expedite the disaster response and the recovery operations.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Storage Sites</strong></p>

<p><strong>Local authority</strong>: A city or county can use its authority to pass local
ordinances in order to establish temporary storage sites. This is one option available in
the absence of a requirement to obtain a solid waste facilities permit for the site.</p>

<p>After reviewing its existing land use ordinances, a jurisdiction can consider taking
the following action(s):

<ul>
  <li>relax storage requirements at the temporary storage site; </li>
  <li>exempt certain discretionary actions from the California Environmental Quality Act; or </li>
  <li>waive storage standards at a particular temporary storage site for emergency storage;
    for example, if it is less than X cubic yards, depending on the local conditions. </li>
  <li>Or, the jurisdiction, through its zoning and land use authority, can establish temporary
    storage areas by passing a new ordinance in response to the emergency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples </strong></p>

<p><strong>Abatement programs</strong>: Following are two examples of ordinances passed to
enact earthquake abatement programs:</p>

<p><strong>City of Santa Clarita</strong>: The City of Santa Clarita passed Ordinance No.
94-01E (Emergency), An Emergency Ordinance of the City of Santa Clarita Establishing the
Santa Clarita Abatement Program for the Mitigation of Structural Hazards and Debris
Removal (see Attachment I).</p>

<p><strong>Town of Los Gatos</strong>: The Town of Los Gatos passed Ordinance No. 1800,
Urgency Ordinance of the Town of Los Gatos Establishing the Los Gatos Restoration Program
for the Repair, Restoration and Reconstruction of Structures Damaged as a Result of the
October 17, 1989 Earthquake (Attachment J).</p>

<p>Identify ordinances dealing with storage/stockpiling. (See discussion under Temporary
Storage Sites in Chapter 4.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of existing ordinance</strong>: Review all ordinances to determine if
they will impact the disaster recovery programs. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the
City of Los Angeles instituted a fencing program as part of the earthquake recovery. In
the interest of public health and safety, and in keeping with the City ordinance requiring
that all swimming pools be fenced, the City contracted for the damaged or destroyed fences
to be repaired or constructed. The City paid for the work even if the fencing was on
private property. </p>
<strong>

<p>Sample</strong> <strong>requirements</strong>: When adopting a local ordinance related to
diverting disaster debris, consider the example requirements described in Attachment K.</p>
