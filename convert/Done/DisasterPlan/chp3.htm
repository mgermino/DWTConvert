<p><strong>Background</strong>: The decision whether to establish a debris diversion
program is made at the outset of the disaster response and in the wake of extreme pressure
to first restore public services and ensure the public health and safety. </p>

<p>Diversion programs may not seem a priority in comparison to the initial life saving
operations that a jurisdiction must undertake. However, with some planning and
forethought, these programs can be implemented and significant savings realized in reduced
labor, transportation, and disposal costs, and preservation of landfill capacity. </p>

<h2>What's in this chapter?</h2>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>: This chapter presents common issues and potential barriers
to the diversion programs discussed in the Plan. </p>

<p>The pre-disaster, or planning, activities are discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, Government
Coordination and Pre-disaster Assessment respectively. By developing the checklists
discussed in these chapters, a jurisdiction can evaluate its level of preparedness to
handle disaster debris and focus on those areas that need to be developed. </p>

<p>Following is a summary of steps integral to developing a debris management strategy and
establishing diversion programs. The 21 steps highlight the issues common to debris
management programs in general. </p>

<h2><a name="sone"></a>Step 1: make diversion programs a priority</h2>

<p><strong>Make it happen</strong>: It is imperative that top management give high
priority to debris diversion programs at the outset and provide the necessary support and
resources for the programs. Without leadership and dedicated support from those directing
the disaster recovery, recycling and diversion programs become secondary in importance,
thus losing opportunities to establish such programs. </p>

<p><strong>Local policies</strong>: Pre-planning is the most effective way to ensure
diversion activities are carried out after a disaster. Jurisdictions can identify and
establish in advance local policies for diversion programs in the event of a disaster. </p>

<p>Another method is for local governing body to pass a resolution stating that in the
event of a disaster, the jurisdiction will implement debris management programs, primarily
diversion programs. </p>

<p>By having local policies in place to require that recycling or other diversion programs
be implemented after a disaster, or routinely, can lend critical support to a
jurisdiction's request to receive FEMA reimbursement for recycling and other diversion
programs.</p>

<p><strong>Authority to act</strong>: The following are examples of how City staff
responsible for implementing the programs and executing contracts for those programs were
given the direct authority to do so by their governing body.</p>

<p>This flexibility allowed staff to concentrate on managing the disaster response by
expending less time on administrative processes to obtain approvals to carry out the
response.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The City of Santa Clarita City Council delegated </p>

<p><strong>City of Santa Clarita</strong>: responsibility to the City Manager to handle
all phases of the disaster response and recovery. The City Manager in turn delegated
responsibility for the development of the debris management strategy and programs to the
Solid Waste Division, which consisted of a staff of three. Even so, the City's earthquake
program realized a 97% diversion rate based on recycling more than 250,000 tons of debris
over an 11-month period.</p>

<p><strong>City of Oakland</strong>: The Oakland City Manager was authorized by emergency
ordinance to take action for the protection of life and property in a disaster. As a
result, during the 1991 Firestorm, the City Manager was authorized to take those actions
necessary to carry out the disaster recovery, which included executing contracts for
debris removal, recycling, and/or disposal. Having such an ordinance in place before a
disaster saved the City considerable time in initiating its disaster recovery operations.</p>

<h2><a name="stwo">Step</a> 2: become familiar with federal debris removal criteria 
and guidelines</h2>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Become familiar</strong>: Upon the Presidential declaration of a major disaster
or emergency, Federal assistance is available. FEMA designates the area eligible for
assistance and the types of assistance available. FEMA may grant assistance for:

<ul>
  <li>debris removal,</li>
  <li>emergency protective measures, and</li>
  <li>the permanent restoration of facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>To increase your jurisdiction's preparedness, become familiar with the type of state
and federal assistance that is available because this will likely determine the type and
scope of debris removal and diversion programs to be established during the recovery
phase.</p>

<p><strong>Attachment</strong>: For more detail on the federal debris removal criteria and
guidelines, refer to Attachment A of this chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="sthree">Step</a> 3: develop a debris removal strategy <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp3b.htm#endnotes">[1]</a> 
</h2>

<p><strong>Two phases</strong>: In its pilot Debris Management Course, FEMA recommends
developing a debris removal strategy for large-scale debris removal operations by dividing
the operation into two phases. </p>

<p>In addition, based upon the experience of California jurisdictions in their recovery
operations, it is recommended that diversion program activities be incorporated into the
Phase II operation, as reflected below.</p>

<p><strong>Phase I</strong> - removing debris that hinders the immediate life saving
actions that pose an immediate threat to public health and safety; and</p>

<p><strong>Phase II</strong> - removing and disposing of debris that hinders the orderly
recovery of the community and poses less immediate threats to health and safety.</p>

<p><strong>Diversion</strong> - include development of debris management strategies,
including establishment of programs for recycling and reuse of the disaster debris, as
well as monitoring of removal and diversion activities to include the tasks in the table
below. </p>

<p><strong>Phases description</strong>: Activities carried out in each phase are described
in the table below:</p>

    allow for the following:<ul>
      <li>movement of emergency vehicles,</li>
      <li>law enforcement,</li>
      <li>resumption of critical services, and</li>

    <td>During the emergency opening of key routes, mixed debris is pushed
    to the shoulders of the roadway, along the public right-of-way. The initial road side
    piles of debris can become the dumping locations for additional yard waste, personal
    property, construction material, trash, etc. <p>&quot;The debris manager
    and staff must now coordinate the removal of this debris, and should be prepared to take
    the following actions:<ul>
      <li>&quot;develop a reliable initial assessment of the disaster's magnitude; </li>
      <li>coordinate through local agencies to establish a contracted work force capable of
        expeditions removal of the debris;</li>
      <li>coordinate with local and state Department of Transportation and law enforcement
        authorities to ensure that traffic control measures expedite debris removal activities;</li>
      <li>evaluate damaged utility systems, structurally unstable buildings, and other
        heavily damaged public facilities and determine if they should be repaired, deactivated,

<h2><a name="sfour">Step</a> 4: identify project scope <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp3b.htm#endnotes">[3]</a> 
</h2>

<p><strong>Project scope</strong>: Identifying the project scope is critical to setting
the parameters for recovery operations (Phases II and III). Take the following steps:

<ul>
  <li>define the project area;</li>
  <li>determine if jurisdiction will remove debris from private property;</li>
  <li>develop an estimate of the types and quantities of debris to be removed (see Chapter 4);</li>
  <li>select temporary storage, recycling, and disposal sites; and (see Chapter 4); and</li>
  <li>determine need for processing facilities and whether existing disposal capacity is
    sufficient for expected volumes of debris.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Private property demolition and debris removal </strong></p>
<strong>

<p>Who is responsible:</strong> The need for private property debris clearance is the first
critical determination that has to be made in defining the specific area or areas to be
contracted. </p>

<p>Debris removal on private property is the primary responsibility of the individual
property owner aided by insurance settlements and assistance from voluntary agencies. </p>
<strong>

<p>Insurance</strong> <strong>coverage</strong>: Most homeowner, fire, and extended coverage
insurance policies have specific coverage for debris removal from private property and for
demolition of heavily damaged structures. Flood insurance policies do not provide coverage
for debris removal. </p>

<p>The standard practice is that the individual property owners are responsible for moving
debris to the curb for pick up by city or county work forces.</p>
<strong>

<p>Public agency responsibility:</strong> In those cases where the individual property owners
are unable to remove the debris from their property, the jurisdiction may determine that
it is in the public interest to remove the debris for them. </p>

<p>Use the following criteria to make this decision:

<ul>
  <li>the debris is an immediate health and safety threat to the general public, or </li>
  <li>the debris is of such a magnitude that the economic recovery of the community would be
    threatened. </li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Example</strong>: <strong>No-cost</strong> <strong>demolition</p>
</strong>

<p>In establishing its building demolition program after the Northridge earthquake, the
City of Los Angeles determined that most of the affected residents did not have earthquake
insurance. As a result, the City assumed responsibility for the demolition of private
structures that threatened the public health and safety. </p>

<p>To help residents rebuild, the City offered demolition services at no cost if the
building had suffered greater than 50% damage or had greater than 35% of its structural
system compromised.</p>
<strong>

<p>Release form</strong>: A standard release form from individual property owners is required
to hold and save the government free of liabilities when government forces or contractors
perform work on private property. (A copy of a typical release form can be found in
Attachment B).</p>
<strong>

<p>Map project area</strong>: Clearly define the limits of the project area by delineating the
boundaries of the project area on a map. </p>

<p>This map will identify to contractors the area or areas to be included in the contract.
</p>

<p>Additionally, in a debris removal project where many contractors may be working, this
can help ensure that the contractors remain in their assigned work area. </p>

<p>Establishing the work area is also important to identify key items such as:

<ul>
  <li>ingress and egress routes to the project area; </li>
  <li>location of utilities; and </li>
  <li>distance to recycling, storage, and disposal sites.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="sfive">Step</a> 5: select a debris management program </h2>

<p><strong>Criteria for selection</strong>: Once a jurisdiction has undertaken an
assessment of its probable waste stream, facilities, temporary storage areas, and markets
for the collected materials, it can then determine the program(s) to be implemented. </p>

<p>For the specific assessment, refer to Chapter 2, Pre-disaster Assessment. This will
indicate the types of materials that could be generated during different kinds of
disasters. Based on the amount and types of debris to be handled, jurisdictions can plan
for diversion programs accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment factors</strong>: The selected program should be best suited to the
jurisdiction based on an assessment of the following:

<ul>
  <li>materials generated, </li>
  <li>facilities available, </li>
  <li>need for temporary storage areas, </li>
  <li>haulers/processors/brokers, </li>
  <li>processing requirements/barriers,</li>
  <li>end-uses for collected materials,</li>
  <li>markets, and </li>
  <li>local conditions. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Most often used</strong> <strong>programs:</strong> Programs most often used include
those in the table on the following pages. For each major program type, there will be
source separated recycling programs to handle a particular waste type. Examples include
mulching and chipping operations for wood, smelting for metals, and concrete crushing.
Issues associated with each of the diversion programs are also included for consideration
as they could impact the program's effectiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Other programs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ghost town program</strong>: Does a city/county assume liability for private
property that has been abandoned by the property owner if the property poses a public
health or safety threat? This may be an issue facing your jurisdiction for which you will
need to develop a policy.</p>

<p>Abandoned property can lower the surrounding propertyvalues or create a public
nuisance. The City of Los Angeles responded by assuming liability for the abandoned
properties and executed a Ghost Town contract whereby the City boarded up, cleaned, and
fenced the abandoned properties. </p>

<p><strong>Condominiums</strong>: In the case of condominiums, FEMA will authorize
demolition work only if all owners of the condominiums participate in the demolition
program. Consider how to handle a situation where not all residents want to participate in
the city or county-sponsored program, thus eliminating the other residents' ability to
have their homes demolished.</p>

<p><strong>Drop-off program</strong>: A drop-off program may be more useful for remote
communities, those where residents do not have curbside pickup, or areas that are sparsely
populated. Issues to consider are contamination of materials and security needs at the
site.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The City of Santa Clarita considered setting up a program
using roll-off bins, but instituted a curbside collection program instead based on the
following considerations:

<ul>
  <li>In order to achieve a high level of service, it would require a roll-off box on every
    corner. It is doubtful that any company could supply this.</li>
  <li>Roll-off container use would increase the amount of mixed waste deposited in them. This
    in turn, would reduce the recycling rate.</li>
  <li>Removing waste from the bins presented the potential for extra equipment since loaders
    are needed to get debris to dumping level.</li>
  <li>Roll-off bins represented a potential increased liability.</li>
  <li>The bins also posed a potentially greater traffic hazard via blind spots from roll-offs
    at every corner versus occasional piles of debris at the curbside.</li>
  <li>The cost for roll-off is potentially more than curbside pickups programs. Beyond the
    initial capital outlay, the City had to consider that FEMA will only reimburse low-cost
    bid. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ssix"></a>Step 6: identify program barriers </h2>

<p><strong>Identify barriers</strong>: Identify potential barriers to a debris management
program and develop contingency plans to avoid problems. This will assist in proposing
solutions to those barriers in advance. Such barriers can include:

<ul>
  <li>blockage of major transportation corridors;</li>
  <li>closure of recycling or disposal facilities;</li>
  <li>lack of funding;</li>
  <li>lack of temporary storage areas (see Chp. 4);</li>
  <li>illegal dumping at temporary storage areas (see Chp 4);</li>
  <li>limited markets for targeted waste types;</li>
  <li>limited contractors available;</li>
  <li>residents, businesses, and other governmental; agencies cleaning up independently of the
    city/county-sponsored program; and</li>
  <li>insurance company requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Liability</strong>: Be aware of the liability issues associated with debris
management and develop procedures to handle the following:

<ul>
  <li>wrong building demolished;</li>
  <li>city workers or volunteers entering and damaging private property City/county
    worker/contractor injured;</li>
  <li>&quot;debris&quot; collected from private property which should not have been removed;</li>
  <li>ghost towns (abandoned property); and</li>
  <li>demolishing a unit in a condominium complex.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rebuilding</strong>: Rebuilding also generates debris. Although rebuilding
activity is a result the disaster, the waste generated is not considered disaster debris.
For this reason, FEMA reimbursement may not be available. Check with your OES Regional
Office to determine the rebuilding activity's funding eligibility.</p>

<p>A jurisdiction, however, can take advantage of diversion programs already established
to handle the disaster debris and capture the rebuilding wastestream. </p>

<p>To avoid confusion, keep the two wastestreams separate so FEMA reimbursement for the
disaster debris program will not be affected. However, this was not possible in Los
Angeles since many victims were still removing earthquake debris while neighbors were
rebuilding. There was no clear end to one activity before beginning the other.</p>

<p><strong>Greenwaste</strong>: In addition, this is the time residents may work on
landscaping their yards and generate large amounts of greenwaste. Again, this is not
debris generated as a direct result of the disaster, and is not eligible for FEMA
reimbursement. </p>

<p>Jurisdictions should take note if this occurs and notify homeowners that the debris
must be kept separate from the earthquake-related debris (that is, do not place this
material at the curbside or place in bins designated for disaster debris, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Source separation</strong>: Source separate materials and leave them at the
curb. In this way, they can be sent directly to processing facilities. If you place all
debris together at the curb, it is more likely that the materials will be sent to a mixed
waste facility, which can be significantly more costly than a recycling facility. </p>

<p>Realize that there will be extra labor costs for separating the collected materials
before they go to a recycling facility. This equates to more time and expense. This can
also be the key to realizing a successful diversion program.</p>

<p><strong>Mixed waste facilities</strong>:&nbsp; Because many jurisdictions may not have
mixed waste facilities nearby, this will limit the diversion potential. In the case of the
City of Los Angeles, one of the City's goals was to establish mixed waste facilities not
only to handle the disaster debris but also to become part of the infrastructure and be
available after the disaster debris was gone.</p>

<p><strong>CalTrans</strong>: The State Department of Transportation (CalTrans) maintains
jurisdiction over any state or federal road. Consequently, when these roads/freeways are
repaired, demolished, or rebuilt, CalTrans is responsible for the cleanup of the resulting
debris. </p>

<p>Although the city or county may have established a diversion program for these
materials collected in a city/county cleanup, it will be necessary to discuss the
diversion of these materials with CalTrans individually. CalTrans can specify in the
cleanup contract that the contractor will divert or recycle the materials. </p>

<h2><a name="sseven">Step</a> 7: set program goals<font FACE="Arial"> </h2>
</font>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: It is important at the outset to set program goals for the
recycling and diversion programs undertaken. Program goals will help determine the
program's success in meeting diversion goals, ensure the program's cost-effectiveness, and
help evaluate whether changes are needed during implementation or whether other programs
need to be established.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: After the Northridge earthquake in 1994, the City of Los
Angeles established goals for their pilot debris removal program which consisted of two
components:

<ol>
  <li>collection of earthquake debris placed at curbside by City residents, and </li>
  <li>demolition of buildings damaged by the earthquake. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Program goals</strong>: The program goals for the pilot program were to: <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp3b.htm#endnotes">[4]</a>

<ul>
  <li>determine maximum recycling rates;</li>
  <li>determine facility needs for a massive diversion effort;</li>
  <li>gain knowledge about the costs associated with a diversion program run at maximum
    efficiency;</li>
  <li>increase, through private investment, the capacity of private sector facilities which
    can process mixed earthquake (and C&amp;D) debris for recovery of recyclables at high
    rates; and</li>
  <li>save landfill space.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DSR for recycling</strong>: Based on the success of the pilot program, FEMA
approved a Damage Survey Report (DSR) for the City's debris removal and recycling program
which was then expanded citywide. (See Attachment D for a copy of the DSR). </p>

<p><strong>DSRs</strong>: Damage assessments and Damage Survey Reports or DSRs are the
foundation for FEMA/OES reimbursement after a disaster. The DSRs provide a description of
the damage, set forth the scope work , and give a cost estimate of the work to be
performed. Based upon the damage assessment conducted by the federal/state/local
inspection teams, a DSR is written. (Refer to Chapter 16 for more information on damage
assessments and damage survey reports).</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Similarly, the City of Santa Clarita, in establishing their
diversion programs after the Northridge earthquake, set up the following program features.
The City identified the following five features as ones that would maximize recovery and
diversion while maintaining an effective collection effort.

<ul>
  <li>No tipping fees. This would discourage illegal dumping.</li>
  <li>Enforcement of illegal dumping ordinances or regulations.</li>
  <li>Provide debris diversion information to haulers and residents.</li>
  <li>Provide security assurance against hazardous materials or contaminated inerts being
    dumped.</li>
  <li>City will assume ownership of material product to ensure reuse.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Contractor</strong> <strong>responsibility: </strong>Although this was one of the City's goals, the
City later changed its position and assigned ownership of the materials to the contractor,
who was responsible for collecting and marketing the materials. The City did this in an
effort to avoid conflict with FEMA over reimbursement for its diversion programs. Had the
City retained ownership of the collected materials and received revenues from their sale,
FEMA could have reduced the City's reimbursement for the diversion program since there was
no compelling local program or plan.</p>

<h2><a name="seight">Step</a> 8: identify labor needs</h2>

<p><strong>Estimate staffing</strong>: An estimate of staffing becomes one of the most
important aspects of disaster debris management as the recovery begins. It is likely that
the jurisdiction's staffing resources will be overwhelmed in responding to the disaster. </p>

<p>Staff will be needed to manage the recovery programs as well as field staff to
implement the programs. There are several resources available that can help a jurisdiction
in its emergency response.

<ul>
  <li>Mutual Aid Agreement;</li>
  <li>Emergency Managers Mutual Aid;</li>
  <li>California Conservation Corps (CCC);</li>
  <li>Employment Development Department (EDD);</li>
  <li>City/county staff available from other agencies; and</li>
  <li>volunteer and non-profit agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Determine staffing needs in light of the diversion program needs. Based<strong> </strong>upon the
selected program, identify staff resources needed, including number and classification of
staff. Identify staff available within the agency and those who may be needed from other
agencies. </p>

<p>Do not underestimate the staffing needed to develop and maintain a tracking system to
monitor the debris recycled and disposed and the facilities used. The system is critical
to verifying weight tickets when used as payment, determining the program's recycling and
disposal rates, and monitoring facility usage. The City of Los Angeles employed six
full-time staff. </p>

<p>For more information, refer to the City of Los Angeles' <i>Northridge Earthquake
Response Effort, Final Report,</i> Issue No. 7, 9/15/95.</p>
<strong>

<p>For assistance:</strong> To request mutual aid from neighboring cities or counties, follow
the Standardized Emergency Management System Mutual Aid procedures (see Chapter 13 for
more information on SEMS). </p>
<strong>

<p>Staff functions:</strong> Keep in mind that staff will be needed for diversion program
implementation as well as for the administrative functions that will serve the overall
recovery operations. A listing of the staff functions that will be needed in recovery
operations is contained in the table, &quot;Departments and Functions Represented in
Recovery Process&quot; on pages 7-9 of Chapter 1.</p>
<strong>

<p>Employment Development Department</p>

<p>Assistance provided:</strong> The <strong>Employment Development Department</strong> (EDD) can provide
workers through the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) contract (funds provided by FEMA
and administered by the State EDD). </p>
<strong>

<p>Plan for workers:</strong> Be aware that the city/county is dependent upon EDD preparing a
plan to use the workers, which FEMA must approve before workers can be hired. In the case
of Northridge, six months elapsed before EDD had completed the plan, although the City of
Los Angeles needed the workers immediately.</p>
<strong>

<p>Job descriptions:</strong> In addition, the JTPA (EDD) contract targeted workers from the
disaster area who had lost their jobs or had otherwise been displaced by the disaster.
However, before EDD can submit a plan to FEMA to use the workers, the jurisdiction must
write job descriptions and determine job classifications for these workers. </p>
<strong>

<p>Consult unions:</strong> Be sure to consult with the unions for city and county workers to
ensure that this outside labor does not affect union agreements. In the case of the City
of Los Angeles, the unions did not object to the contract.</p>
