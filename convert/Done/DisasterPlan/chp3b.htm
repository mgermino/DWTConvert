	</ul>
		<h2><a name="sten">Step</a> 10: choose a method of operation </h2>

<p><strong>Method</strong>: Choose a method of operation for the selected program. Decide
the following in advance:

<ul>
  <li>who will implement the program;</li>
  <li>will the material be source separated at the curbside, placed in bins, roll-off
    containers;</li>
  <li>how will collection routes be established;</li>
  <li>who will collect the materials; and</li>
  <li>how will materials be identified for collection (GIS, pick-up crews drive through
    neighborhoods, hotline).</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Who implements:</strong> Determine who will implement the diversion programs: city or county
staff or contractors. </p>
<strong>

<p>Example: Special Engineering Organization. </p>
</strong>

<p>After the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, the Mayor and City Council decided that City
forces could handle the recovery operations at a cost savings as compared to contracting
out for the recovery work. In response, the City of Los Angeles' Department of Public
Works implemented an earthquake debris removal program. The program was led by the Bureau
of Engineering, with support from the Bureau of Contract Administration, which provided
field monitoring of contractors, and the Bureau of Sanitation, Integrated Solid Waste
Management Office, which directed the recycling efforts. </p>
<strong>

<p>Engineering organization:</strong> Within the Bureau of Engineering, the Northridge
Earthquake Recovery Division was created. Staff from various Divisions within the Bureau
were assigned to the new ad hoc division and assumed responsibilities for different
aspects of the earthquake recovery. After the work was completed, the Division was
subsequently disbanded.</p>
<strong>

<p>Advantages:</strong> Establishing this Division aided in the City coordinating all
earthquake-related activities and simplified FEMA billing for disaster-related costs. In
this way, the City could document that all activities performed by this Division were
earthquake related and therefore reimbursable by FEMA.</p>
<strong>

<p>Example</strong> Alternatively, the City of Oakland let a master contract for <strong>master
contract:</strong>debris removal and recycling. Such a contract can expedite clean-up and
allows for traffic control and coordinated restoration of utilities. The latter keeps
utilities from being continually re-damaged by heavy loads of debris. Wear and tear on
roads is also eligible to be reimbursed as part of the master contract.</p>

<p>Critical issues need to be resolved if a master contract is used: <a href="chp3b.htm#endnotes">[6]</a>

<ul>
  <li>who pays - insurance, local government, property owner, state or federal?</li>
  <li>who assumes liability?</li>
  <li>what if property owners don't want to participate?</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>City of Los Angeles:</strong> The City of Los Angeles adopted the following operational
approach to maximize recycling of curbside debris: <a href="chp3b.htm#endnotes">[7]</a>

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li>Contract language. </strong>To achieve recycling goals, collection contracts included
    language indicating that the City required recycling, and that contractors were expected
    to utilize recycling facilities under City contracts in a particular order of preference. 
	<br />
	The inspectors listed the facilities in an order which required that contractors use
  recycling facilities first. Contractors were permitted to utilize disposal facilities only
  when recycling facilities were closed, temporarily over capacity, or had waiting times
  which would have inhibited efficiency of collection operations.
  
  <li><strong>Authorization letters</strong>. Authorization letters to utilize facilities under City
    contract were distributed to contractors and included the recycling preference. Carbon
    copies were returned to the site inspector allowing immediate load tracking capability
    (see Attachment E for copy of letter). The City developed authorization letters that the
    haulers used in lieu of paying the tipping fee at disposal and recycling facilities. The
    authorization letter allowed the facility to bill the City directly and benefited the
    hauler who did not have to pay the fee and wait for reimbursement from the City. It also
    ensured that the contractors would use recycling facilities, since there was no cost to
    them. 
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Recycling plans. </strong>Contractors selected for contract awards were required to submit
    recycling plans at the time of contract signing. They were trained at the time of contract
    signing and provided with training booklets for their field staff regarding program
    guidelines and facility requirements before starting work (<i>Northridge Earthquake
    Recycling Requirements for Contractors).</i></li>
</ul>


<ul>
  
  <li><strong>Performance criteria. </strong>Performance criteria were used to rate contractors on their
    good faith efforts to recycle and their actual recycling rates. Points were given to the
    contractor if:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>they dedicated trucks for recycling, </li>
    <li>their field supervisors were trained regarding City recycling requirements, and </li>
    <li>the contractor's supervisors scouted for concentrations of recyclables each day. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Recycling rates in the form of percentage of loads to recycling facilities were
tabulated from the inspectors' daily status reports.

<ul>
  <strong>
  <li>Monitoring and enforcement. </strong>Field inspectors monitored the contractor's work and
    enforced recycling requirements in the field to maximize recycling without impeding
    efficiency of operations.<br />
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Valid permit. </strong>Recycling facilities had to maintain a valid solid waste facilities
    permit and agree to City monitoring and evaluation guidelines to participate in the
    program.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="seleven">Step</a> 11: adapt program length<strong> </strong></h2>

<p><strong>Set a limit</strong>: Depending on the extent and severity of the disaster
event, a jurisdiction will have set an estimated completion time for the diversion program
to be implemented. In large part, this will be dependent on the program funding,
particularly from FEMA, and on the volume of work to be performed.</p>

<p><strong>Factors</strong>: Several factors will influence the length of time the
diversion program is needed. Consider these:

<ol>
  <li>the extent and severity of the disaster;</li>
  <li>program funding from FEMA;</li>
  <li>the time between the disaster and when homeowners receive their FEMA.insurance, or Small
    Business Assistance checks; and</li>
  <li>if the disaster is a regional one, the ability of contractors to keep up with the heavy
    demand for their services.</li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>Example:</strong> In the case of the City of Los Angeles, the disaster debris was being
picked up from households for 1-1/2 years after the Northridge earthquake. The City of
Santa Clarita's curbside program lasted a year; it was initially thought the program would
end after six months.</p>
<strong>

<p>Peaks of waste</strong> <strong>generated</strong>: From past disasters, it appears there
will be three peaks where disaster debris is generated.

<ol>
  <li>The first will be a large influx of debris immediately after the disaster event
    consisting of household debris and putrescibles as people begin the initial cleanup of
    their homes and businesses.</li>
  <li>The second peak will occur approximately six to nine months after the disaster when
    homeowners begin to receive their FEMA assistance, insurance, or Small Business Assistance
    checks. This is when the debris is removed and rebuilding begins. Expect an influx of
    debris at this time. </li>
  <li>The third peak will occur during the rebuilding phase, again when homeowners and
    businesses receive FEMA, insurance, or Small Business Assistance checks or when
    contractors become available. After these three peaks it appears that the collection of
    disaster debris levels out and that the disaster wastestream will become steady and last
    upwards of 1-2 years, depending on the severity of the disaster.</li>
</ol>
<strong>

<p>FEMA deadlines:</strong> Keep in mind that FEMA sets a completion deadline of six months on
debris removal projects. If a jurisdiction needs a time extension, it must apply for one
through the Office of Emergency Services. (Refer to Chapter 16, Federal Assistance
Program, for additional information).</p>
<strong>

<p>Suggestion:</strong> To ensure that program funding from FEMA continues uninterrupted,
review your program progress after four months to determine if a time extension or
additional funding is needed. If more time or funds is needed, this will give you two
months' lead time to process the request so that funding is not cut off before the program
ends. </p>
<strong>

<p>Local criteria:</strong> Develop local criteria to determine if your jurisdiction needs to
request a time extension to complete the work and to request additional funding from FEMA.
The criteria can include such items as:

<ul>
  <li>daily loads</li>
  <li>tonnages;</li>
  <li>number of demands for debris pickup from the public; and</li>
  <li>number of requests for earthquake-related building permits. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>to differentiate between earthquake-related work and regular construction activity, the
      City of Los Angeles instituted a tracking system whereby a different numbering system was
      used for earthquake-related building permits.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="stwelve">Step</a> 12: develop funding options
</h2>

<p><strong>Reimbursement</strong>: To initiate its recovery efforts, a jurisdiction must
be knowledgeable about the state and federal reimbursement programs and the process for
requesting funding. </p>

<p>Because Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) typically reimburses program costs,
not advances them, a jurisdiction will need to identify funds to start-up programs until
federal funding becomes available.</p>

<p>Small projects: FEMA will advance funding for &quot;small projects &quot; as contained
in individual Damage Survey Reports. For &quot;large projects,&quot; funding occurs as a
reimbursement. Consult with OES regarding the dollar amount associated with each category
type as it is tied to the Consumer Price Index.</p>

<p><strong>Actions to take</strong>: This following actions will assist in identifying
funding sources to start-up diversion and/or recovery programs.

<ul>
  <li>Identify local or private funds that can be used to start program until receive FEMA
    reimbursement.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>determine ability to use General Fund; </li>
    <li>evaluate possibility of acquiring a loan; and</li>
    <li>explore use of private funds.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare documentation re local policy for diversion/recycling.</li>
  <li><strong>NOTE: FEMA may/will not reimburse for donated monies or services.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Research documentation for FEMA regarding existing
local policy for recycling or diversion. </p>

<p>FEMA's policy to date has been to reimburse for the &quot;least cost&quot; programs,
and reimburse for diversion programs if they are in keeping with an existing policy of the
jurisdiction. </p>

<p>However, the jurisdiction must document such policies, provide adequate documentation
to FEMA, and receive their approval prior to implementing the diversion program in order
to receive reimbursement.</p>

<p><strong>Do in advance</strong>: Compiling this information in advance can save valuable
time in receiving approval to proceed with the diversion programs and to begin the
recovery process.</p>

<h2><a name="sthirteen">Step</a> 13: establish a public information program</h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: A diversion program can only be effective if it is
supported by good public information or outreach program. An effective public information
program will realize two goals: provide adequate advertisement of the debris collection
program as well as educate the residents and contractors involved in carrying out the
program. </p>

<p>Unless this program is taken seriously and resources applied to implement it, plans to
recycle and otherwise divert the disaster debris may go unrealized. </p>

<p><strong>Steps to take</strong>: Based on the experiences of other local jurisdictions
that have undertaken disaster recovery programs, following are some suggestions in
establishing your public information and outreach program.

<ul>
  <li>Coordinate with the city/county public information officer (PIO) in development of a
    public awareness campaign for the debris management programs. <p>This can include Public
    Service Announcements (PSAs) on the radio and TV, printed materials such as doorhangers
    and newsletters, to advertise locations of drop-off centers, conditions of curbside
    collection, hours, materials accepted, collection method, etc. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Structure a public information campaign so that messages reach target groups at home, at
    work, and at leisure.</li>
  <li>Establish a public information or media center to handle debris management questions
    from the public.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>cleanup instructions;</li>
    <li>status of cleanup;</li>
    <li>respond to public inquiries;</li>
    <li>locations of drop-off or collection sites;</li>
    <li>how to source separate;</li>
    <li>enforce provisions against illegal dumping; and</li>
    <li>complaints re debris piles or illegal dumping via a geographic information system (GIS).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Develop contact list for the media: television, radio, cable access, ham operators,
    newspapers, neighborhood newsletters.</li>
  <li>Set up a hotline for the public to call regarding debris management programs and/or for
    debris pickup.</li>
  <li>The Public Information Officer (PIO) may be responsible for hosting the media and
    visitors at the disaster area. </li>
  <li>Identify all target groups, particularly those non-English speaking groups, and the
    geographical areas where they reside. OES can provide maps of the areas where different
    languages are spoken and the approximate number of speakers of each language.</li>
  <li>Determine need for interpreters and translators based upon above.</li>
  <li>Provide fact sheets to the public in English and predominant non-English languages in
    the area. </li>
  <li>Develop a Public Information Plan or Public Information Mutual Aid Agreement. Contact
    your nearest OES Regional Office for more information..</li>
  <li>Consider setting up a mobile information center.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Take into account that changes in policies and programs may
well affect your diversion program. The City of Los Angeles used the Good Year Blimp in
January 1995 to advertise to City residents that the earthquake pickup program had ended.</p>

<p>This was an innovative approach to getting the word out to the public; however, FEMA
subsequently extended the debris program for six months. Another idea could include
renting a small plane with a banner to advertise the programs.</p>

<p><strong>Regional cooperation</strong>:Costs for advertising in the media can be
prohibitive, yet using the media can be the best way to notify as many residents as
possible about the diversion programs and how to participate in them. The City of Los
Angeles was quoted a price of $16,000 for a one-day 1/4 page ad in the Los Angeles Times
to advertise their curbside pickup program.</p>

<p>The City of Santa Clarita was also implementing a curbside pickup program at the same
time. A problem developed when Santa Clarita residents assumed the instructions in the
Times for the City of Los Angeles programs applied to their local program. To avoid
confusion, the City of Santa Clarita changed a number of its program guidelines to be
consistent with those of the City of Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Had the cities been able to combine their efforts by establishing similar program
guidelines and advertising their programs jointly, not only could they have saved money,
but there would have been less confusion about the two curbside programs.</p>

<h2><a name="sfourteen">Step</a> 14: develop a monitoring and enforcement program<strong><font FACE="Arial"> 
</h2>
</font></strong>

<p><strong>It's a must</strong>: Monitoring is the key to achieving success in any
diversion or recycling program. Monitoring will help a jurisdiction evaluate and enhance
recycling facility capacity, assess the effectiveness of contractor training, improve
enforcement by inspectors, and manage program costs. Following is a list of actions that
will support a successful diversion program.

<ul>
  <li>garner the support and cooperation of those in authority to institute the monitoring
    program;</li>
  <li>dedicate sufficient resources to ensure program success;</li>
  <li>develop methods to monitor and enforce recycling/diversion guidelines;</li>
  <li>establish guidelines for compliance and incorporate as part of contract; and</li>
  <li>develop tracking system to verify amounts and types of materials diverted and disposed
    to document FEMA reimbursement and to calculate recycling rates.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inspection and Control System</strong></p>
<strong>

<p>Inspection</strong> <strong>system:</strong> Local jurisdictions should maintain an inspection and
control system under its own supervision to ensure that the work being performed complies
with the terms of the contract. </p>
<strong>

<p>Factors to consider: </strong>In addition to load ticketing, consider the following factors
in the inspection and control process:

<ul>
  <li>bond requirements;</li>
  <li>insurance requirements;</li>
  <li>rights-of-way and indemnification;</li>
  <li>mobilization of proper equipment;</li>
  <li>posting of permits;</li>
  <li>contractor personnel safety standards;</li>
  <li>general public safety standards;</li>
  <li>completion schedules; </li>
  <li>clearance procedures; and</li>
  <li>demobilization procedures.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Progress</strong> <strong>reports: </strong>It is important that the contract requires submission of
reports and payment estimates, in order to aid in the evaluation of the contractor's work
progress.</p>

<p>In lieu of progress reports, frequent visits to the job sites can be a productive
method of monitoring performance.</p>
<strong>

<p>Incentives</strong>: Inspectors, or incentive programs, are needed to ensure that full loads
are taken to the processing facilities rather than half empty trucks. Consider an
incentive for a hauler to completely fill a truck before going to the disposal/recovery
facility (i.e., pay by weight), rather than paying haulers per trip. However, paying by
trip may be necessary in order to offer an incentive to haul low density materials such as
wood and insulation.</p>
<strong>

<p>Oversight:</strong> In addition, continual oversight by inspectors is needed to ensure that
the hauler goes to the preferred facility (e.g. recycling) and that the crews loading the
debris use material separation techniques.</p>
<strong>

<p>Contractor</strong>&nbsp; <strong>performance:</strong>The City of Los Angeles experienced significant
increasesin the overall recycling rate in 7/94 due to the introduction of a contractor
performance rating system. This gave contractors an incentive to take loads to source
separated facilities. The introduction of this system increased source separated facility
usage by 191% and significantly decreased recycling tipping fee costs. (Refer to Step 8,
method of operation, for additional detail on the performance rating system).</p>

<h2><a name="sfifteen">Step</a> 15: develop a contingency plan</h2>

<p><strong>Roadways or facilities impacted</strong>: In the event that major roadways are
closed or landfills and recycling facilities are closed or damaged, develop a contingency
plan to deal with the disaster debris until such time as the roads and facilities are
open.

<ul>
  <li>Develop a procedure for temporary storage of the collected materials (refer to Chapter
    4, Temporary Storage Sites, for more information).<br />
  </li>
  <li>Develop a policy to deal with putrescibles and with waste from the public until a
    diversion program is implemented. Because this will likely be the responsibility of the
    local sanitation department, coordinate closely with that department.<br />
  </li>
  <li>If the landfills you use are closed, make arrangements with neighboring jurisdictions
    or, if applicable, private landfill owners to use their facilities. Do this before a
    disaster strikes since it may take valuable time to negotiate the agreement and receive
    approvals, particularly from the local government governing body.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Develop alternate transportation routes.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Decide in advance how to fund programs initially, since FEMA operates on a reimbursement
    system. <br />
  </li>
  <li>Fewer contractors/haulers may be available if a disaster hits a large geographic area or
    very populous area. Some options can be to:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>identify contractors in the area who have the abilities and equipment to handle the
      work; </li>
    <li>of those contractors identified above, identify those who can respond in an emergency;
      and </li>
    <li>pre-qualify contractors to expedite the contracting process and disaster response from
      within and outside the area;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>When developing a list of pre-approved contractors, update the list every six to 12
        months. At the same time, check to see that the contractors are holding the appropriate
        licenses and that those licenses are valid. </li>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>: Contractors will have to show proof of worker's compensation and
        liability insurance before entering into a contract. The local jurisdiction's risk manager
        will have to determine the minimum levels of coverage. <strong>Verify with OES/FEMA that
        insurance premiums are reimbursable</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<h2><a name="ssixteen">Step</a> 16: pursue regional coordination </h2>

<p><strong>Coordinate with neighbors</strong>: Consider developing a debris management
program in concert with neighboring jurisdictions to direct a coordinated disaster
response, to save time and resources, and to provide services to all affected residents.
This will necessitate coordination with the OES and FEMA to correctly allocate program
costs and reimbursement to the appropriate jurisdiction, but a more efficient program can
be achieved.</p>

<p><strong>Program crosses boundaries</strong>: Particularly in urban developments, debris
management programs can cross jurisdictional boundaries. Instead of each city establishing
a separate, and perhaps conflicting, program for its residents, it would benefit all if
they pooled their resources and established a single response (program) that would meet
the needs of all affected residents. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Problems arise when not all cities in a geographic area
affected by the disaster establish a debris collection program. For example, City X had a
successful curbside pickup program which was achieving a high degree of diversion. A
neighboring city, however, did not implement a diversion or collection program for its
residents. As a result, residents of the neighboring city would haul their disaster debris
to the city with the collection program and place it on the curb. </p>

<p><strong>Problems encountered</strong>: This subsequently became a significant problem
for City X. Residents of the neighboring city were not adhering to the program guidelines
of source separation at the curbside and collection of designated materials. As a result,
the contamination of curbside materials increased significantly and reduced the diversion
potential of the materials.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: It is also a good idea to coordinate programs with
neighboring communities, particularly in densely populated urban areas. For example,
residents of the City of Santa Clarita participated in their city curbside collection
program, but began following the instructions for the City of L.A. program as advertised
in the L.A. Times, assuming that it applied to them. As a result, to reduce confusion, the
City of Santa Clarita changed a number of their program components to be consistent with
those of the City of L.A.</p>

<h2><a name="sseventeen">Step</a> 17: develop incentives for diversion
</h2>

<p><strong>Incentive</strong>: The method that the City of Los Angeles found to have the
most potential for success in ensuring that the high priority facilities (recycling) were
visited first, involved some sort of incentive program. </p>

<p>If the drivers received a perk for adhering to the criteria, more material would be
recycled and a great deal of money would be saved in the form of reduced tipping fees and
reduced staff time dedicated towards policing cleanup crews and haulers.</p>

<p><strong>Encourage diversion</strong>:&nbsp; Develop methods to encourage diversion.
These can include the following ideas:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Methods to encourage diversion</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>No tipping fee, or reduced tipping fee, for recycling/reuse</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Penalties for disposing of disaster debris: Hauler, Landfill, Processor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Local ordinances that would require applicants for permits for new construction and
    demolition to submit a waste management plan showing materials to be diverted or salvaged.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Issuance of new construction and demolition permits with list of recycling facilities
    attached. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priority to sating new recycling facilities over permitting new disposal facilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ban on landfilling of, or adding surcharge to, reusable or recyclable materials
    (provided that facilities and markets are established).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Provide local fee and tax credits for businesses that deal in salvaged and recycled
    building materials.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: After the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, the City of Santa
Cruz waived the tip fee for materials taken to the landfill to encourage residents to
recycle their disaster debris. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Noncompliance fees are also an effective incentive for
diversion. </p>

<p>Prior to the City of Los Angeles instituting a non-compliance fee in their curbside
hauling contract, two thirds of the contractors did not go to recycling facilities. After
the noncompliance fee of $400 a load was added to the curbside contract, the City reported
that 29 of 30 contractors surveyed did use the recycling facilities. On average, the City
employed 55 contractors for this work at any given time. A total of 361 contractors were
used.</p>

<h2><a name="seightteen">Step</a> 18: compile documentation and develop tracking 
system <a href="chp3b.htm#endnotes">[8]</a> </h2>

<p><strong>FEMA</strong> Ensure that adequate documentation is maintained to support
funding requests to the state and federal governments. Refer to the following document for
guidelines on the kinds of documentation needed, which may in turn affect the tracking
system used and the information collected. For more information on documentation, see
Chapter 5, Contracts.

<ul>
  <li>Guidelines for Documenting Disaster Costs for Federal and State Public Assistance
    Programs (contained in Public Assistance Subgrantee Disaster Assistance Resource Manual,
    OES).</li>
</ul>

<p>The tracking system can be used to:

<ul>
  <li>verify payment to haulers, facilities;</li>
  <li>document recycling rates;</li>
  <li>satisfy state and federal reporting requirements; and establish an audit trail.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Example:</strong> For the City of Los Angeles, one of the conditions FEMA required when
approving the City's proposal to implement a recycling program was the development of a
system to document the level and effectiveness of recycling.</p>

<p>The City developed a database system to track the amount and type of tonnage delivered
to each facility, facility cost, and truck type to deliver the debris.</p>

<p>The system included tonnage reconciliation and material composition information for
each facility that processed mixed debris.</p>

<p>The system was based on data entered from each facility's daily load tickets. </p>

<p>Note: because of the significant number of tickets (200,000 total) and diversity of
facility types, the system required six staff to maintain the database.</p>

<p>The load tickets from each recycling facility were collected daily. Information
reported included tonnage, cost, truck type, and material data.</p>

<p><strong>Recycling rate</strong>: Once materials were processed at mixed recycling facilities, the
materials shipped for recycling and residual trash tonnages hauled to landfills were
compared with tonnage input from load tickets. This &quot;reconciliation&quot; served as
the basis for development of recycling rates.</p>

<h2><a name="snineteen">Step</a> 19: develop training program</h2>

<p><strong>Training guide</strong>: It is a good idea to provide training to contractors
and haulers to ensure they understand the diversion program and will implement it. It is
just as important to train inspectors and field personnel in diversion program components.</p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles developed a training guide entitled Northridge Earthquake
Recycling Requirements for C-21 Contractors which lists the City's requirements, materials
specifications, and recycling and disposal facilities. All haulers were given the manual
and trained on program guidelines. </p>

<p><strong>Educate haulers</strong>: One of the most difficult aspects of the program may
be educating the haulers on the preferable sites to haul the material to and then ensuring
that they followed through on the instructions. </p>

<p>As an example, the City of Los Angeles placed recycling facilities in higher preference
to mixed disposal facilities. However, the recycling facilities may not have been the most
preferable facility in the hauler's mind. The hauler may have chosen a facility based on
distance, familiarity, or absence of truck scales on route rather than recyclability of
material or disposal cost since the City bore the brunt of these costs.</p>

<p>Prepare guidelines for private haulers on recycling and diversion of C&amp;D materials,
facilities to use, and methods to reduce contamination of materials. One way to distribute
this information is to do so when building permits are issued.</p>

<h2><a name="stwenty">Step</a> 20: set up a records retention system and archives</h2>

<p><strong>Set up system</strong>: It is important to establish a records retention system
for the disaster debris program. At the conclusion of the City of Los Angeles' Northridge
earthquake recycling programs, the City had more than 200 archive boxes of contracts,
invoices, recycling data, and other administrative records. The City stored these records
in preparation for a FEMA audit. Further, a computer database was developed to track the
location of the archive boxes and their contents. </p>

<p><strong>Guidelines</strong>: The City of Los Angeles suggested that a records retention
system include the following:

<ul>
  <li>A filing system to assure that records are organized from program inception to
    completion.</li>
  <li>Guidelines for which agency will have long-term custody of the records, who will manage
    the filing system and records retention database, and who will arrange access to the
    records for future auditors and program staff after program completion.</li>
  <li>Guidelines for the types of records that will be retained and those that can be recycled
    at program completion.</li>
  <li>Space requirements are identified and plans for long-term storage of archives.</li>
  <li>A computerized records retention system to track location of materials for future
    audits.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="stwentyone">Step</a> 21: prepare a final report</h2>

<p><strong>Why needed</strong>: A final report of program activities and results may be
required for FEMA reimbursement for diversion programs implemented. This report allows
jurisdictions to evaluate program success and areas for improvement and is crucial for
future disaster debris planning purposes. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The City of Los Angeles prepared a Final Report, based
primarily on its curbside collection program, entitled Northridge Earthquake Response
Effort: Recycling Activities for City Sponsored Earthquake Debris Removal Program, Final
Report, 9/15/95. </p>

<p>The Final Report's major topic areas are presented below as an example of the types of
program information that should be collected.

<ul>
  <li>program goals;</li>
  <li>operational approach;</li>
  <li>facilities used;</li>
  <li>program monitoring;</li>
  <li>recycling rates achieved for both source separated recycling and mixed debris recycling;</li>
  <li>program costs for tipping fees: recycling and disposal facilities; contractors (C-21 for
    debris removal/loading, and trucking;</li>
  <li>landfill space savings;</li>
  <li>tonnage and % of materials sent to source separated and mixed facilities;</li>
  <li>tonnage and % of materials recycled and disposed of;</li>
  <li>recycling rates by material type;</li>
  <li>program costs by ton - recycling compared to disposal;</li>
  <li>demonstrated program effectiveness, and</li>
  <li>lessons learned and areas for improvement.</li>
