<p><strong>Background</strong>: Contracts and franchise agreements are pivotal to ensuring
a successful debris management program. Unless diversion is specified, it is likely the
collected debris will be disposed of. </p>

<p>Regardless of the diversion program selected, the best way to divert disaster debris
from landfills is to ensure that the contracts for debris removal include provisions
requiring that the disaster debris be diverted from landfills through reuse, recycling, or
other waste diversion techniques. </p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong>: This chapter contains ten sections.</p>

<h2><a name="sone">Step</a> 1: Perform contract services assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Develop in advance</strong>: The best approach to disaster response is
pre-disaster planning. Taking the following actions in advance allows time for the
development of contract terms and conditions, cost estimating, legal review, and
identification of potential contractors. </p>

<p>Identify and review existing contracts, franchise agreements, and mutual aid agreements
in effect to help determine your contract needs based on the type of work to be performed.
</p>

<p>In assessing your contracts and other agreements, make note of the following:

<ul>
  <li>any services that are provided relating to disaster debris;</li>
  <li>whether the contracts contain any relevant provisions dealing with disaster debris;</li>
  <li>whether the existing contract can be used as the vehicle to provide emergency cleanup
    work, either as written or modified; and </li>
  <li>what you can require in terms of diversion programs if they are not specifically
    included in a franchise agreement.</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Contractors</strong>: When developing a list of pre-approved contractors,
update the list every six to 12 months. At the same time, check to see that the
contractors are holding the appropriate licenses and that those licenses are valid.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Contractors will have to show proof of worker's compensation and
liability insurance before entering into a contract. The local jurisdiction's risk manager
will have to determine the minimum levels of coverage. <strong>Verify with OES/FEMA that
insurance premiums are reimbursable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Non-disaster waste</strong>: The best approach is to keep disaster-related
debris separate from non-disaster debris. Commingling the two wastestreams can compromise
the city/county's reimbursement for the diversion program. As an alternative, set up
separate contracts for disaster debris and non-disaster debris and keep separate records
for each. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This was not possible in the City of Los Angeles. Many victims
were still removing earthquake debris while neighbors were rebuilding. There was no clear
end to one activity before beginning the other.</p>

<h2><a name="stwo">Step</a> 2: Coordinate with haulers</h2>

<p><strong>Do in advance</strong>: The franchise and independent hauler can be
instrumental in establishing a diversion program and in expediting debris cleanup. </p>

<p>It is important to coordinate with your franchise hauler in advance to:

<ul>
  <li>determine the services and equipment they can provide in an emergency, and </li>
  <li>develop a contingency plan should they not have the staff or equipment available. </li>
</ul>

<p>This could include writing contracts for services the franchise hauler normally would
provide but is unable to do so because of a shortage of staffing or equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Disaster clause</strong>: Determine if your franchise agreement contains a
&quot;disaster clause&quot; requiring the franchisee to provide emergency cleanup services
in the event of a disaster (provide equipment, labor, and diversion or disposal of
collected materials). If not, it would be wise to include such a clause at the time the
franchise agreement is renegotiated. </p>

<p>Ensure that your disaster clause includes the use of the franchisee's facility,
equipment, and labor. </p>
<strong>

<p>Example:</strong> At the time of the Northridge earthquake, the City of Santa Clarita did
have a franchise agreement with a disaster clause. It allowed them use of the franchise
equipment and facility; however, it did not include the city's right to use franchise
employees. As a result, the City did not have the staff needed to operate the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Waivers from subcontractors</strong>: Be sure to get waivers from
subcontractors releasingthe jurisdiction from liability. If the contractors do not pay
their subcontractors, the subcontractors can then place a lien on the property where they
removed debris and sue the jurisdiction to recover payment. Or, as an alternative, include
such a provision in the contract for services.</p>

<h2><a name="sthree">Step</a> 3: Assess need for short- and long-term operations
<a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[1]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Short- and long-term operations</strong>: A jurisdiction will probably need
both short- and long-term contracts in its recovery program. Define the scope of the
project and then select the type of contract needed depending upon the type of operation
undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="sthreea"></a><strong>Short-term operations </strong><a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[2]</a></p>

<p><strong>First 100 hours</strong>: Short-term operations are defined as those undertaken
during the first 100 hours after a disaster. One method of contracting early in a disaster
is the &quot;<strong>time and materia</strong>l&quot; type of contract. </p>

<p>This contract type is used immediately after a disaster for emergency life saving
activities and debris clearance. Under this type of contract, the contractor is paid on
the basis of time spent in accomplishing a particular task. This contract is acceptable if
a <strong>cost ceiling</strong> is placed on the contract to build in cost controls.</p>

<p>Since short-term debris operations primarily involve equipment usage, the contract
should be set up on an hourly basis. The &quot;time and material&quot; contract then
becomes a &quot;time&quot; contract only. </p>

<p><strong>Bid requests</strong>: Bid requests should specify that the hourly rate will
include all fuel, maintenance, repair, etc., and the operator. This can greatly simplify
the bookkeeping, auditing, and monitoring of the work. </p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Short-term agreements allow for more flexibility in
program operations. After the Northridge earthquake, the City of Los Angeles used only
short-term (1-2 week) contracts with haulers. Longer contracts, which corresponded to the
terms of the City's Damage Survey Reports, were written for the use of the various
disposal and recycling facilities.</p>

<p><a name="sthreeb"></a><strong>Long-Term Operations</strong> <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[3]</a></p>

<p><strong>Services after first 100 hours</strong>: If your jurisdiction determines that
the situation is beyond the capabilities of existing resources (mutual aid, State and
volunteer labor and equipment), then you should consider developing an organization to
administer and manage a long-term contract operation.</p>

<p>Since the after effects of a disaster can be felt for months or even several years, the
local jurisdiction cannot necessarily rely on short-term agreements for assistance. In
addition, the prolonged recovery by local forces and contractors likely will require a
long-term operation.</p>

<p><strong>Primary factors</strong>: The primary factors influencing the size and
complexity of the long-term debris operations are:

<ul>
  <li>the composition and volume of debris; </li>
  <li>the area of debris concentration;</li>
  <li>the location of temporary storage sites, recycling sites, and disposal sites; and </li>
  <li>the need for private property debris removal. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Options</strong>: There are two contracts typically used for long-term debris
removal operations. They are the <strong>Lump Sum</strong> contract and the <strong>Unit
Price</strong> contract. </p>

<p>As an alternative, a jurisdiction can establish a <strong>special engineering
organization</strong>, either with force account personnel or with a local engineering
firm, to undertake all project management operations related to debris collection,
diversion, and/or disposal. Each of these options is discussed below.</p>

<h2><a name="sfour">Step</a> 4: Select contract type <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[4]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Three types</strong>: There are three contracts typically used in obtaining
disaster debris services . They are:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Time and material contract;</li>
  <li>Unit price contract;</li>
  <li>Lump sum contract.</li>
</ol>

<p>A sample contract for each contract type above is found in Attachments A, B, and C
respectively.</p>

</table>

<p><strong>Examples </strong></p>

<p>Following are three methods to obtain disaster response services:

<ul>
  <li>Master Contract,</li>
  <li>Individual contracts, and</li>
  <li>Special Engineering Organization.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Master contract</strong></p>

<p>Jurisdictions may choose to write a master contract covering all phases of debris
collection, diversion, and/or disposal. In this situation, a prime contractor is hired
with subcontractors, reporting to the prime contractor, hired to carry out specific tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Example: City of Oakland</strong></p>

<p>After the 1991 firestorm the City of Oakland wrote a master contract covering debris
removal, recycling, and disposal. The prime contractor then subcontracted with a number of
subcontractors for different aspects of the cleanup activities.</p>

<p><strong>Individual contracts</strong></p>

<p>Enter into individual contracts of short duration with a number of different
contractors. This method can provide flexibility in changing contract provisions as the
program is refined.</p>

<p><strong>Example: City of L.A.</strong></p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles selected contractors on a weekly basis for the 45 areas the
City had designated for disaster cleanup.</p>

<h3><a name="sfoura">A</a>. Time and material contract
<a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[5]</a> </h3>

<p>&nbsp; <strong>When to use</strong>: Time and material contracts should only be used:

<ul>
  <li>during the first 100 hours of the recovery operation to perform emergency life saving
    debris clearance, and</li>
  <li>only after all available local and State government equipment has been committed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Contract</strong> <strong>provisions:</strong> The contract should clearly state that:

<ul>
  <li>the price for the equipment applies only when the equipment is operating; </li>
  <li>the jurisdiction reserves the right to terminate the contract at its convenience; </li>
  <li>the jurisdiction does not guarantee a minimum number of hours; and</li>
  <li>there is a cost ceiling for total work performed.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="sfourb">B</a>. Unit price contract <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[7]</a></h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Unit Price and Lump Sum contracts are recommended
after the immediate response phase. </p><p>
The Unit Price Contract utilizes construction units and prices for these units to develop
line item costs and total contract cost. </p>

<p><strong>Scope of work</strong>: The Unit Price Contract is used when:

<ul>
  <li>the scope of work may be defined, and</li>
  <li>generally quantified by actual field measure, (e.g., 200 cubic yards of sand, 10 tons of
    rubble, 7 trees, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: The total &quot;bottom line&quot; of the contract may
increase or decrease depending upon the accuracy of the unit quantity. </p>

<p>For this reason, it is as important to properly estimate units as it is to estimate
unit cost. </p>

<p><strong>Use accurate units</strong>: The unit used in the Unit Price Contracts must be
as accurately estimated as units possible; otherwise, the final bottom line amount of the
contract will be significantly different from the contract bid received at the bid
opening. </p>

<p><strong>Attachments</strong>: </p><p>
Attachment B contains a model Unit Price Contract. <br />
Attachment D contains the City of Los Angeles' Unit Price Contract.</p>

<p><strong>Payment under unit price contract</strong></p>

<p><strong>Load ticket</strong>: Payment under a unit price contract is normally made on
the basis of a load ticket.

<ul>
  <li>Load tickets should be treated as accountable forms. The operations office should know
    what forms have been issued, how many have been issued and to whom.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="sfourc"></a><strong>C. LUMP SUM CONTRACT</strong> <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[8]</a></p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: The Lump Sum Contract establishes a total contract price
by a one item bid from the contractor. For this type of contract, the price for the work
is fixed unless there is a change in the scope of work to be performed. The bottom line of
the contract is not in question as it is with the Unit Price Contract. </p>

<p><strong>Scope of work</strong>: If the scope of work is not well defined, this method
of contracting puts the responsibility of the quantity estimate and the definition of the
scope of work on the shoulders of the contractor bidding the project. </p>

<p>Consequently, experience has shown that the contractor will pass this burden back to
the owner in the form of contingencies which will be incorporated into the bid price.</p>

<p><strong>When to use</strong>: As mentioned before, the Lump Sum Contract should be used
only when the scope of work is clearly defined and the areas of work can be specifically
quantified. A model Lump Sum Contract can be found Attachment C.</p>

	<h2><a name="sfive">Step</a> 5: Determine need to establish special 
	engineering organization <a href="../DisasterPlan/chp5b.htm#endnotes">[11]</a> </h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To undertake long-term operations, a special engineering
organization can be formed immediately for the purpose of identifying the full scope of
the project. This organization can handle all project management operations related to
debris collection, diversion, and/or disposal.</p>

<p><strong>Local firm vs own staff</strong>: The jurisdiction may wish to hire a local
engineering firm for this purpose, if the community's internal engineering staff is
heavily involved with the repair and replacement of publicly owned facilities damaged by
the disaster. </p>

<p><strong>Funding limitation</strong>: FEMA will only pay overtime for force account
personnel performing emergency work (e.g., debris removal). However, FEMA will pay <strong>ALL</strong>
eligible costs for contracted labor. </p>

<p>This is an important point to keep in mind when deciding whether to undertake the
debris removal operations with force account personnel or to enter into a contract for the
work.</p>

<p><strong>Example: After the 1994 Northridge Earthquake</strong>: The Mayor and City
Council decided that City forces could handle the recovery operations at a cost savings as
compared to contracting out for the recovery work. In response, the City of Los Angeles'
Department of Public Works implemented an earthquake debris removal program. The program
was led by the Bureau of Engineering, with support from the Bureau of Contract
Administration, which provided field monitoring of contractors, and the Bureau of
Sanitation, Integrated Solid Waste Management Office, which directed the recycling
efforts. </p>

<p><strong>Engineering organization</strong>: Within the Bureau of Engineering, the
Northridge Earthquake Recovery Division was created. Staff from various Divisions within
the Bureau were assigned to the new ad hoc division and assumed responsibilities for
different aspects of the earthquake recovery. After the work was completed, the Division
was subsequently disbanded.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Establishing this Division aided in coordinating all
earthquake-related activities and simplified FEMA billing for disaster-related costs. In
this way, the City could document that all activities performed by this Division were
earthquake related and therefore reimbursable by FEMA.</p>

<p><strong>Staffing requirements</strong> At a minimum, the engineering organization will
need: </p>
