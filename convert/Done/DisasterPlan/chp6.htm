<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>A disaster can be devastating to a jurisdiction's
resources, both in personnel and in funds. The job of protecting lives and property will
begin immediately after the disaster; however, funding from the state and FEMA will not
follow so quickly. </p>

<p>To get started in its recovery efforts, a jurisdiction must be knowledgeable about the
state and federal reimbursement programs and the process for requesting funding. This
chapter also gives guidelines for receiving reimbursement for recycling programs even if
they are not &quot;least cost&quot; as is FEMA's policy.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong>: This chapter has 8 sections:</p>

<h2><a name="sone">Step</a> 1: Role of the Office of Emergency Services <a href="chp6.htm#endone">[1]</a></h2>

<p><strong>OES role</strong>: The State Office of Emergency Services (OES) is responsible
for administering the Public Assistance Program under The Stafford Act. </p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: OES is responsible for:

<ul>
  <li>administering the grant for all funds provided under the FEMA Public Assistance Grant
    Program available to eligible private non-profit organizations, state and local
    governments and special districts after a Presidential declared disaster or emergency.</li>
  <li>serving as the communications link between the subgrantee and FEMA during the entire
    recovery process;</li>
  <li>providing State support for damage survey activities; and</li>
  <li>providing technical advice and assistance to eligible subgrantees.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Direct questions</strong> <strong>OES:</strong> OES will coordinate all requests for assistance to
FEMA. Direct your questions and concerns to your OES Applicant Services Representative
(ASR). OES is your advocate for receiving state and federal assistance and can help make
the recovery process an easier one. (See Attachment A `for a listing of regional offices
and contacts).</p>

<h2><a name="stwo">Step</a> 2: Reimbursement program</h2>

<p><strong>Reimbursement level</strong>: Local governments and special districts will be
reimbursed for not less than 75% of eligible disaster-related costs under the federal
public assistance program and up to 25% under the California Natural Disaster Act (NDAA).</p>

<p><strong>Eligible costs</strong>: Eligible costs for reimbursement include:

<ul>
  <li>permanent repairs to damaged facilities, </li>
  <li>eligible emergency work, and </li>
  <li>protective measures. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Public Assistance Program</strong>: The Public Assistance program is intended
to be a reimbursement program. In most cases, funds must be expended before the applicant
may receive disaster assistance grant funds. </p>
<strong>

<p>Lengthy process:</strong> This reimbursement process is a lengthy one involving the review
of damage estimates. Actual receipt of funds may take weeks or months.</p>
<strong>

<p>Cash flow:</strong> Anticipate that a jurisdiction must fund diversion programs until FEMA
reimburses the program costs. This may necessitate using general funds or taking out a
private loan.</p>

<h2><a name="sthree">Step</a> 3: Federal/state cost share</h2>

<p><strong>Cost share</strong>: Following is the breakdown of federal/state and local cost
shares established as minimum under the Stafford Act. The cost share is also subject to
FEMA-State Agreement.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Agency</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Cost share %</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>FEMA</strong></td>
    <td>pays a minimum of 75% of the eligible disaster-related costs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>State OES</strong></td>
    <td>generally pays up to 75% of the remaining 25% of the non-federal costs;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>local government </strong></td>
    <td>is responsible for 25% of the non-federal share or 6.5% of total eligible
    costs. However, this 6.5% can be less, depending upon the circumstances.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>OES does not share in the costs incurred by a state agency.</p>

<p><strong>Cost share</strong>: The division of costs among Federal, State, and local
governments is a negotiable item. The minimum federal share under the Stafford Act is 75%.
However, depending on the circumstances, the Federal government may assume a larger
percentage of the costs. </p>

<p><strong>Typical costs</strong>: The federal/state share is typically 75%/25%, but this
varies depending upon the extent of the disaster as outlined in the FEMA/State Agreement
for that declaration. It is based upon the State's ability to pay the cost share. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Sometimes a threshold dollar amount is used. For example, for
eligible project costs up to $100,000, the cost share may be 75%/25%, but after that it
may be 90%/10% or 100 % reimbursed by FEMA.</p>

<h2><a name="sfour">Step</a> 4: FEMA-state agreement <a href="chp6.htm#endtwo">[2]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Content of FEMA-State agreement</strong>: After the President's declaration of
a major disaster or emergency, the Governor and the appropriate FEMA regional director
execute a FEMA-State Agreement. The agreement:

<ul>
  <li>prescribes the manner in which Federal aid under the Stafford Act is to be made
    available,</li>
  <li>lists the areas within the state that are eligible for assistance;</li>
  <li>stipulates any division of costs among federal, state, and local governments; and</li>
  <li>specifies the period recognized as the duration of the major disaster or emergency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Negotiations</strong>: It is when the FEMA-State team is developing this
agreement that the state (OES) can negotiate the state cost share with FEMA. Typically the
federal/state share is 75%/25%. However, in the case of the Northridge earthquake in 1994,
the federal/state share was 90%/10%; for Loma Prieta the federal share was 100%.</p>
<strong>

<p>Various factors:</strong> Keep in mind that many factors go into the determination of the
cost share and that the particular circumstances of each disaster or emergency will vary.</p>

<h2><a name="sfive">Step</a> 5: Reimbursement for diversion or recycling 
program</h2>

<p><strong>Confirm program eligibility</strong> Obtain written approval from FEMA for the
reimbursement of the diversion program before instituting the diversion program. This is
to ensure that FEMA will reimburse the jurisdiction for all program costs. Establishment
of a diversion program can often hinge on whether a city/county has the funds to start up
such a program until federal funding becomes available. </p>

<p><strong>Loan</strong>: A jurisdiction may need to draw upon its general funds, obtain a
loan, or use private funds to establish a program until FEMA reimbursement is received.</p>

<p><strong>Least cost</strong>: FEMA's policy to date has been to reimburse for the
&quot;least cost&quot; programs, and reimburse for diversion programs if they are in
keeping with an existing policy of the jurisdiction. </p>

<p>However, the jurisdiction must document such policies, provide adequate documentation
to FEMA, and receive their approval prior to implementing the diversion program in order
to receive reimbursement.</p>

<p><strong>FEMA consultant</strong>: Local jurisdictions should be aware that if they do
not have local expertise on the reimbursement process, they can ask for assistance from
the Federal, State, or private resources to help them with the reimbursement process.</p>

<p>Please refer to the NDAA and FEMA guidelines as to whether reimbursement for a private
consultant can be reimbursed.</p>

<h2><a name="ssix">Step</a> 6: City of Los Angeles' earthquake recycling 
program
<a href="chp6.htm#endthree">[3]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: After the Northridge earthquake in 1994, the City of Los
Angeles negotiated with FEMA to receive reimbursement for recycling activities. The City,
state OES, and FEMA agreed upon a Damage Survey Report (DSR) with a scope of work that
included monitoring the recyclable debris and waste generated by the City's Demolition and
Debris Removal Program and assisting in the development and implementation of recycling
programs. (See Attachment B for a copy of the DSR).</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: The City provided documentation to FEMA that the City
had an <strong>existing</strong> policy of recycling to justify spending more than
&quot;least cost&quot; if necessary. Take note that this effort took approximately three
months to resolve. </p>

<p><strong>Pilot program</strong>: To demonstrate to FEMA that recycling was a viable
option to disposal of disaster debris, the City established a pilot curbside collection
program that lasted from 2/19/94 to 3/20/94. </p>

<p><strong>Identify diversion potentia</strong>l: The pilot was conducted as a means to
identify the potential for recycling the curbside debris collected under contract to the
Bureau of Engineering by private contractors <a href="chp6.htm#endfour">[4]</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Lost time</strong>: The City of Los Angeles estimated that three months had
passed before their recycling programs were up and running, which meant that a good deal
of recyclable materials were sent to the landfill.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion</strong>: Ensure that your jurisdiction has on record a policy of
diverting waste from landfills through recycling or other diversion programs. This can
take the form of an ordinance, resolution, a debris management plan, or actions taken to
implement diversion programs, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Check with OES</strong>: Coordinate with your OES contact to determine the
specific documentation FEMA requires for reimbursement of diversion or recycling programs
that cost more than &quot;least cost&quot; as FEMA policies can change and can differ from
previous disasters.</p>

<p><strong>City of L.A. documentation</strong>: Also included in Attachment A is a copy of
a letter to FEMA from the City of Los Angeles providing backup documentation to
demonstrate local/state/federal policies that give preference to recycling as a waste
management strategy for Los Angeles. </p>

<h2><a name="sseven">Step</a> 7: Payment <a href="chp6.htm#endfive">[5]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Table</strong>: The table below shows the payment federal and state cost
shares:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th COLSPAN="2"><strong>Federal Share</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Small Project DSRs </td>
    <td>OES will automatically issue 100% of the federal share for small project
    DSRs. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Large Project DSRs</td>
    <td>To receive payment for large project DSRs, you must complete the Request
    for Reimbursement (OES Form 131).<p>You can receive reimbursement for up to 75% of the
    federal share large project DSRs. The remaining 25% will be withheld until final
    inspection.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td COLSPAN="2"><strong>State Share</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Upon completion and submittal of the OES Form 96 and the NDAA Form 3, you
    will receive payment for not less than 75% of the state share of your approved DSRs. (The
    state share is 25% of the total cost of the project).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Small projects</strong>: Regarding Small Project DSRs, per Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) 44 Section 206.203, the threshold dollar amount differentiating small
from large projects varies with disasters since it is adjusted annually to reflect changes
in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor. </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: For the 1995 Winter Storms, an individual project was
designated a small project if costs were less than $43,600.</p>

<p><strong>Large projects</strong>: Regarding Large Project Damage Survey Reports, the
withholding varies according to the Federal-State Agreement for each disaster. For
example, for the Northridge Earthquake, only 10% of the Federal Share was withheld.</p>

<p><strong>Required forms</strong> <a href="chp6.htm#endsix">[6]</a>: Local governments and
special districts must submit the following forms to receive payment:</p>

<h2><a name="seight">Step</a> 8: Establishing a special trust fund <a href="chp6.htm#endseven">[7]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Once the County project application has been accepted,
DSR's approved, and funds obligated by FEMA, OES will authorize reimbursement for actual
expenditures on approved DSRs only. </p>

<p><strong>Large projects</strong>: For large projects OES initially pays out 90% of the
75% federal share to cities and counties, and 75% of the 75% Federal share for state
agencies, special districts and eligible private non-profits.</p>

<p>Small projects: Small project DSRs are paid in full after DSR approval. In general, the
amount will be 100% of FEMA's 75% share of the total approved amount.</p>

<p><strong>Board action</strong>: Prior to the funds arrival, the County shall establish
by action of the Board of Supervisors a special disaster trust fund for deposit and
disbursement of disaster funds.</p>

<p>State OES <em>always</em> requires funds to be in an &quot;non-interest bearing&quot;
fund.</p>

<p><strong>Trust title</strong>: The title of the trust fund shall include the established
disaster FEMA number, i.e., DR 677, DR 651, etc. Using this format allows quick reference
as to which disaster the monies are for, rather than using titles such as Jones Tract
Levee, or other titles, which could be used several years in a row.</p>

<p><strong>Advancing funds to departments</strong>: Expenses to date will be advanced
providing the department produces full documentation. (Advances can be made at different
stages of the project.) This will alleviate the problem of a bad audit trail.</p>

<p>An entry is developed by the Auditor's Office for each trust fund in order to keep
track of the number of invoices paid, to whom paid, invoice number, and category number.
This entry allows document search in the final audit.</p>

<p><strong>County disbursement</strong>: The County Auditor-Controller will disperse funds
from the Special Trust Fund when the County Local Agent (OES) has reviewed the records of
the completed work and is satisfied that all supporting documentation is available. The
Local Agent may request a County auditor to assist in the document review.</p>

<p><strong>Single audit act</strong>: The Auditor-Controller Office will send an annual
&quot;account activity&quot; report to fill out. This report is an overview of the amount
of fiscal activity from the trust fund. The report is part of the overall County Single
Audit Act report that FEMA requires.</p>
