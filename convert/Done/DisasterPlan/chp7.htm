<h2><a name="sone">Step</a> 1: Mutual aid system</h2>

<p><strong>Statewide system</strong>: California's disaster planning is based on a
statewide system of mutual aid. Each local jurisdiction:</p>

<p>Relies first on its own resources, then calls for assistance:

<ul>
  <li>city to city, </li>
  <li>city to county, </li>
  <li>county to county, and </li>
  <li>county to the regional office of the OES, </li>
  <li>which relays unmet requests to the State.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Master Mutual Aid agreement</strong>: A California Master Mutual Aid Agreement
has been adopted by most cities and all 58 counties in California. </p>

<p>This agreement creates a formal structure within which each jurisdiction retains
control of its own personnel and facilities, while giving and receiving help whenever it
is needed. The State is a signatory to this agreement and provides available resources to
assist local jurisdictions in emergencies.</p>

<p><strong>Six regions</strong>: The State of California is currently divided into three
administrative regions and six OES mutual aid regions . Regional managers, their staff and
any designated state agency representatives constitute the regional emergency management
staff. A map of the regions and OES contact names appear in Attachment A.</p>

<p><strong>Table</strong>: The California Mutual Aid Program, channels of coordination,
and mutual aid systems are shown in the following table.</p>

<h2><a name="stwo">Step</a> 2: Mutual aid for debris management</h2>

<p>Consider entering into a Mutual Agreement with neighboring jurisdictions for debris
management when the jurisdiction has exhausted its resources and response capabilities
after a disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: A Model Mutual Aid Agreement is contained in Attachment B; a
city or county may consider developing such an agreement with neighboring jurisdictions. </p>

<p><a name="pworks"></a><strong>Public works</strong>: A Public Works Mutual Aid Plan and
Procedures Agreement, which may provide more specific assistance related to debris
management, is under development by the OES Southern Region; jurisdictions may consider
adopting a similar agreement. For more information, contact the Emergency Operations and
Training Officer at the OES Southern Region, (310) 795-2900.</p>

<p><a name="pinfo"></a><strong>Public information</strong>: In addition, a Public
Information Mutual Aid Plan has been adopted by San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and
Ventura Counties. Local governments may find this useful in developing a similar Plan to
obtain resources to coordinate public outreach and media activities. Contact the nearest
OES Regional Office for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="sthree">Step</a> 3: Emergency Managers Mutual Aid (EMMA) <a href="chp7.htm#endnotes">[2]</a></h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: City and county emergency managers in the OES Coastal,
Southern, and Inland Regions developed a coordinated emergency management concept called
the Emergency Managers Mutual Aid (EMMA) system, which worked very successfully during the
Northridge earthquake recovery. </p>

<p>The purpose of EMMA is to provide <strong>professional emergency management personnel</strong>
in the form of mutual aid to impacted areas to support disaster operations. </p>

<p><strong>EMMA system</strong>: The EMMA system is composed of emergency managers from
cities and counties. The State Office of Emergency Services (OES) maintains mutual aid
inventories and facilitates mutual aid among Operational Areas (counties) and among OES
Regions. OES will also maintain EMMA personnel inventories at the regions and headquarters
as they are developed.</p>

<p><strong>Local government managers</strong>: City and county managers can provide
jurisdictions with invaluable technical assistance and expertise in debris management
programs through this program. </p>

<p><strong>Requesting EMMA</strong>: To request (EMMA) mutual aid, follow normal mutual
aid channels consistent with the California Master Mutual Aid Agreement. Contact the
nearest OES Regional Office for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Reimbursement</strong>: All associated costs incurred by the jurisdiction
providing assistance will be eligible for reimbursement as part of &quot;emergency
protective measures&quot; (Category B) described in the State Natural Disaster Assistance
Act when a state of emergency has been declared and by Public Law (PL) 93-288 when there
is a Presidential declaration of a major disaster. The providing jurisdiction must
document all costs and invoice the requesting jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Those providing mutual aid will be responsible for
maintaining their own logs, time keeping and other documentation necessary for
reimbursement. This documentation must be submitted to their accounting departments so the
requesting jurisdiction can be involved appropriately.</p>

<p><strong>Reimbursement</strong>: State and federal governments may provide reimbursement
for mutual aid when there is a Governor's proclamation of a State of Emergency or a
Presidential Declaration of a Major Disaster. <strong>There are no other provisions for
state mutual aid reimbursement</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Liability</strong>: Local governments are responsible for providing liability
and property damage insurance coverage on apparatus and equipment used beyond their
territorial limits.</p>

<p><strong>Injuries</strong>: Work related injuries to EMMA personnel will be handled by
the assisting jurisdiction under Workers' Compensation which may include the Disaster
Service Worker program. No special registration is required as all public employees are
considered to be disaster service workers during disaster situations.</p>

<p>EMMA Assignments: EMMA personnel assignments will be restricted to:

<ul>
  <li>local government and operational area Emergency Operations Centers, </li>
  <li>Regional Emergency Operations Centers, and </li>
  <li>Disaster Service Centers.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>12-hour period</strong>: Mutual aid will be limited to a 12-hour period between
jurisdictions when there is no emergency declaration in effect. It is anticipated that for
such events neighboring jurisdictions would be requested.</p>

<p><strong>7-10 days</strong>: Mutual aid assignments for declared emergencies will be for
a 7 to 10 day period.</p>

<p><strong>Activation </strong></p>

<p>The system can be activated for small, single jurisdictional emergencies or for
large-scale disasters involving multiple jurisdictions.</p>

<p><strong>Small scale</strong>: On a small-scale activation requiring mutual aid between
two cities within the same Operational Area (county), request assistance of a neighboring
jurisdiction through the Operational Area. The Operational Area will be responsible for
coordinating and documenting any mutual aid within their Operational Area.</p>

<p><strong>Operational area to another</strong>: When mutual aid is requested from one
Operational Area to another, route requests through the OES Region. At this time, the
Regional Administrator will activate the EMMA Coordinator.</p>

<p><strong>Region to region</strong>: When mutual aid is requested from one Region to
another, direct the request to the requesting jurisdiction's region.</p>

<p>During a multi-region incident, route requests for mutual aid through the State
Operations Center (SOC).</p>

<h2><a name="sfour">Step</a> 4: Actions to take</h2>

<p><strong>Table</strong>: When evaluating alternatives to staffing and equipment,
consider taking the following actions mutual aid agreements</p>

    <td>Explore possibility of entering into discipline-specific mutual aid
    agreements, such as those for public works, Emergency Management Mutual Aid, or public
    information.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Steps A &amp; B: Review agreements</h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Review the mutual aid agreements your city or county is a signatory to and list the
types of assistance available through those agreements. </p>

<p>Based on this review, your jurisdiction may identify mutual aid agreements that it
needs to develop, or, for an existing agreement, become a signatory to.</p>

<p>A Model Mutual Aid Agreement is contained in Attachment B. A city or county may
consider developing such an agreement with neighboring jurisdictions specifically for
debris management.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step C: Explore discipline-specific mutual aid agreements</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Public works</strong>: A Public Works Mutual Aid Agreement, which may provide
more specific assistance related to debris management, is under development by the OES
Southern Region; jurisdictions may consider adopting a similar agreement. For more
information, contact the Emergency Operations and Training Officer at the OES Southern
Region, (310) 795-2900.</p>

<p><strong>Public information</strong>: In addition, a Public Information Mutual Aid Plan
that has been adopted by San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, contact
OES; local governments may find this useful in developing a similar Plan to obtain
resources to coordinate public outreach and media activities.</p>

<p><strong>EMMA program</strong>: Also consider the Emergency Managers Mutual Aid (EMMA)
program, which is composed of emergency managers from cities and counties. The State
Office of Emergency Services (OES) maintains mutual aid inventories and facilitates mutual
aid among Operational Areas (counties) and among OES Regions. These emergency managers may
be able to provide technical assistance and advice on debris management programs. Contact
the nearest OES Regional Office for more information.</p>
