<p><strong>Primary program</strong>: One of the primary methods used by jurisdictions to
remove material after a disaster is a curbside waste pickup program. Cities and counties
implement curbside pickup programs to remove debris from the street after businesses and
homeowners have placed the materials in front of the property.</p>

<p><strong>Plan ahead</strong>: Immediately following a disaster, such as a flood or
earthquake, the material removed from the street via a curbside pickup program tends to be
commingled. </p>

<p>The initial response to a disaster is to remove the material that poses both a threat
to health and safety and prevents access to structures and property. It is unlikely that
much of this material will be diverted and recycled unless the local jurisdiction has
prepared adequately and implemented a disaster plan with all elements necessary to address
the barriers to waste diversion.</p>

<p><strong>Flexible plan</strong>: A disaster plan must be flexible. Any plan, no matter
how well thought out, must be amended at some point in the process. Therefore, those who
implement the cleanup must periodically review the operation and be willing to address
shortcomings or unforeseen changes in either scope or implementation. Planning is
imperative, but no one can anticipate all possible scenarios in addressing a disaster
cleanup.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong>: In any curbside pickup program, there are some basic
requirements and resulting steps that need to be addressed and implemented. Those steps
are listed below followed by a short discussion. A number of steps are integral to any
debris management program in general, and as such, specific discussions are contained in
either Chapter 2, Pre-disaster Assessment, or Chapter 3, Debris Management Programs.
However, the action steps are listed in sequence.</p>

<p><strong>More info</strong>: Also refer to Chapter 17 for case studies on curbside
collection programs established by the Cities of Los Angeles and Santa Clarita in response
to the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.</p>

<h2><a name="sone">Step</a> 1: Quantify/qualify material</h2>

<p><strong>Estimate types and quantities</strong>:&nbsp; It is useful to estimate the
types and amounts of material that may result from a disaster in order to determine
potential processing and transportation needs. </p>

<p>However, accurate quantification is probably impossible to obtain until after a
disaster strikes. It is generally more valuable to a local jurisdiction to estimate the
types of material rather than quantities prior to a disaster in order to determine
processing needs and abilities in the area. </p>

<p><strong>Major waste categories</strong>: A general conclusion can be drawn from various
studies that have documented the composition of demolition waste. The major waste
categories tend to be masonry (concrete, asphalt, brick, rubble), wood, gypsum, and
metals. </p>

<p><strong>Pilot program</strong>: In some cases, a pilot program can be tested in the
area, but that is only feasible if long-term cleanup operations are expected such as those
that occurred in the Los Angeles area following the Northridge earthquake.</p>

<p><strong>Waste stream changes</strong>: A good curbside pickup program will also
recognize that the types and amounts of material will change as time progresses. </p>

<p>After the initial debris has been removed, to restore some form of order to the area,
local residences and businesses will begin to rebuild. The rebuilding process will
generate new flows of material as a result of both demolition and construction activities
well beyond the immediate cleanup following a disaster. These activities will also
generate wastes that can be more easily segregated, which may allow higher rates of
recycling.</p>

<p>There will also be materials generated immediately after the disaster such as plastic
drinking water bottles, plastic sheeting, sand bags, and food. The City of Malibu had
thousands of sand bags to dispose of after the fires in 1993, and there were thousands of
plastic drinking water bottles to deal with after the initial Northridge earthquake
response.</p>

<h2><a name="stwo">Step</a> 2: Determine processing and facility needs</h2>

<p><strong>Identify operations</strong>: As stated above, part of material
qualifying/quantifying is to determine current processing abilities and potential future
needs. At a minimum, jurisdictions should identify operations currently in the area that
process construction and demolition waste and potentially those operations that could
process those materials in the future. Document these facilities, their locations and
processing capabilities. Make a note if any of these facilities have concrete crushers or
tub grinders. </p>

<p><strong>Landfills</strong>: In addition to processors, note which landfills in the area
are practicing material separation on site as well as any other material recovery
facilities in the area. These facilities, in addition to having the ability to process
disaster debris, could potentially serve as storage sites and should be identified. These
sites could be used for intermediate staging and potentially short-term processing
following a disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Recycling options</strong>: Also consider your options as far as recycling and
disposal sites is concerned. If your recycling facility or landfill is (damaged) closed
due to the disaster or the routes to the facilities are blocked, have plans to utilize
other facilities operated by neighboring jurisdictions. </p>

<p>It is best to have completed these discussions and reached agreement before the
disaster since it might take action by your respective City Council/Boards of Supervisors
to authorize the use of these facilities; if not done beforehand, valuable time can be
lost in negotiating their use.</p>

<p><strong>See page</strong>: Refer to Chapter 2, Pre-disaster Assessment, for more
information.</p>

<h2><a name="sthree">Step</a> 3: Determine labor/equipment needs</h2>

<p><strong>Estimate needs</strong>: Estimating equipment and labor needs, prior to a
disaster occurring, with any accuracy is nearly impossible. However, it is very useful to
determine what equipment is currently available that can be used in response to a
disaster. </p>

<p><strong>Mutual aid</strong>: Furthermore, if it has been determined that the available
equipment will likely be inadequate, the local jurisdiction may want to consider entering
into a mutual aid agreement with neighboring jurisdictions to supply personnel and
equipment in the event of a disaster. A model mutual aid agreement is contained in the
following attachments in this section (refer to Chapter 7, Mutual Aid, for more
information). </p>

<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: A new program established by the Office of Emergency Services
during the Northridge earthquake recovery is the <em>Emergency Managers Mutual Aid</em>
program. Through this program experienced emergency managers from public agencies will be
available to assist jurisdictions in recovery operations, such as setting up debris
management programs.</p>

<p><strong>Local businesses</strong>: The local jurisdiction may also consider documenting
the local businesses that are involved in the demolition as well as waste transport and
handling operations. If manpower needs arise, as a result of a disaster, these businesses
may be available on a contract basis. </p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles concluded that utilizing the resources of existing businesses
would be the quickest route to implement a curbside pickup program as well as help
establish a waste separation and recycling infrastructure that would be in place after the
rebuilding period passed.</p>

<p><strong>CCC and EDD</strong>: Another option that jurisdictions may consider for
manpower needs is to utilize the resources of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) or
the Employment Development Department (EDD). </p>

<p>While both the CCC and EDD may be a source of manpower for a community recovering from
a disaster, they should both be considered long-term options rather than avenues for
immediate manpower needs following a disaster. Negotiating a contract for personnel from
either agency will take time; consequently, this should not be considered a viable option
in the primary response to a disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Liability</strong>: There are also liability issues to consider when using
volunteers or staff from the CCC or EDD. They may be injured or damage private property
during the course of their cleanup activities. See Attachment B for sample waiver forms.</p>

<p><strong>See page</strong>: Refer to Chapter 2, Pre-disaster Assessment for more
information.</p>

<h2><a name="sfour">Step</a> 4: Secure funds for program</h2>

<p><strong>Secure funds</strong>: Plan ahead and secure funds. The most important part of
a successful curbside collection program is pre-planning. Planning is necessary if the
program is to be implemented in a timely manner, and funding is necessary if it is to be
implemented at all. </p>

<p>Even if the program is eligible for reimbursement from a federal program such as FEMA,
the FEMA reimbursement will not occur immediately. There needs to be some sort of funding
mechanism in place until reimbursement occurs. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: FEMA may/will not reimburse for donated monies or services. </p>

<p><strong>See page</strong>: Refer to Chapter 6, Reimbursement, for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="sfive">Step</a> 5: Determine method to locate curbside waste</h2>

<p><strong>Locate waste</strong>: Regardless of the method used, the jurisdiction should
determine how it plans to assess the amounts and types of material placed on the curbside
for pick-up. </p>

<p><strong>Site identification</strong>: A discussion of Geographic Information System
(GIS) versus canvassing the streets is contained in the discussion below titled &quot;Site
Identification.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The City of Los Angeles chose to send out staff with maps to
mark the streets that had rubble to be hauled. The City determined this was the most
effective method to maximize the cleanup crews' time and transporters' hauling capacity as
well as to minimize tip fees by transporting source separated material. Others may choose
to use more sophisticated methods such as GIS. Either method will maximize equipment and
resources when collecting the debris. </p>

<p><strong>Scout neighborhoods</strong>: Scout neighborhoods. The City of Los Angeles
stressed that it is extremely important to identify the types and locations of debris
piled up in the streets prior to dispatching crews to collect it. </p>

<p>This allows for consolidation of similar types of debris (i.e. wood, aggregate, metal,
wallboard, insulation) so that full loads of like material can be brought to source
separated processing stations, thus minimizing transportation and disposal costs and
increasing the likelihood that the materials will be recycled. </p>

<p><strong>Debris identification</strong>: Debris identification can be accomplished in
various ways. In hilly areas the City of Los Angeles scoped the neighborhoods using City
staff contractors and marking types of materials and locations on a map. Some contractors
will do this prior to dispatching crews, but not necessarily. This is probably something
that should be negotiated in the contract. </p>

<p>Although the City of Los Angeles chose to blanket the neighborhoods with mobile crews,
a GIS could also be used for identifying locations. Regardless of the method, the primary
goal is to maximize capacity of the cleanup crews while collecting as much similar types
of debris as possible.</p>

<h3>Curbside pickup site identification</h3>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: When implementing a curbside pickup program following a
disaster, planning is imperative to maximize the resources available. Regardless of the
method used, some preliminary field work is needed to ensure that similar loads of debris,
as well as full loads of materials, are transported to recycling and disposal facilities.
To accomplish the preliminary site mapping, two approaches can be taken. </p>

<p>They are as follows: </p>

<p><em><strong>GIS Mapping</strong></em></p>

<p>A global information system (GIS) can be used to map out a targeted area and pre-plan
material pickup schedules to maximize both resources and equipment. In its simplest
application a GIS is used to electronically collect the attributes of a site in a
hand-held controller. </p>

<p>The system's software then determines a three-dimensional Global Positioning System
position for you. Various software packages can compile the information in numerous
fashions which best fit the needs of your organization.</p>

<p><strong>Pros/cons</strong></p>

<p>The advantages of GIS is that it is quick, offers the ability to evaluate the data in
several forms, and offers several competing forms of software and hardware. </p>

<p>The disadvantages include the need to purchase/lease the software and hardware and the
need to still go out into the field to identify the pickup locations. </p>

<p>Furthermore, depending on the system, additional time may be needed to learn the system
before it can be adequately implemented. </p>

<p>However, if a local agency already has a GIS, or if there is a potential need for one
in the future, implementing a GIS for curbside pickups in response to a disaster may be
justified. </p>

<p><strong><i>Canvasing streets</i></strong></p>
<strong>

<p>Identify on map</p>
</strong>

<p>An alternative to using a GIS is to have staff canvas the streets and identify the
types of materials in the area to increase source separated recycling opportunities.
Locations of material piles can be marked on a map. This information can be used to
determine crew size, pickup routes as well as primary disposal and recycling locations.
These would be developed before the disaster.</p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles chose this method over GIS. The City felt that the learning
curve for the GIS that they had would take too long. The City preferred to dedicate the
time towards immediate cleanup efforts. </p>
<strong>

<p>Advantages</p>
</strong>

<p>The advantages to canvasing the streets are:

<ul>
  <li>immediate results, </li>
  <li>almost no learning curve, </li>
  <li>avoided cost of a GIS, as well as the fact that </li>
  <li>the staff must patrol the streets even with a GIS to locate the material piles.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>Decision factors</p>
</strong>

<p>An individual jurisdiction must decide which method to use to identify locations for
curbside pickups. The decision is based on various factors including:

<ul>
  <li>cost, </li>
  <li>availability of systems, </li>
  <li>response time, </li>
  <li>size of area, and </li>
  <li>future needs. </li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which method is chosen, it is extremely important to plan pickup
locations and routes to minimize resources and disposal costs and to maximize reuse of
materials.</p>

<h2><a name="ssix">Step 6</a>: Determine method of implementation</h2>

<p><strong>Who will implement</strong>: This portion of the program has several aspects.
The jurisdiction must determine who will implement the program: the local government
employees, or contracted private businesses. </p>

<p><strong>Materials to collect</strong>: Next, the type of material collected must be
determined. This will determine the markets and facilities needed to process the
materials. </p>

<p>Will commingled waste be collected or only source separated waste? Commingled waste
requires additional labor and time to separate the materials, which can add significantly
to the cost of and length of time to operate the program. </p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles collected all waste at the curb, but indicated that if this
program were implemented again, it would require the waste to be separated by type at the
curb if the City was to pick it up at no cost. The City of Santa Clarita implemented its
program in this fashion with great success. </p>

<p><strong>Source separate</strong>: Consider collecting only source separated material at
the curb. Although the City of Los Angeles did not institute this requirement in its
curbside pickup program, staff indicated that source separation is something they would
require in future disaster cleanups. </p>

<p>The City of Santa Clarita imposed this requirement during cleanup of its earthquake
debris and made it work. This would require extensive notification that only source
separated material would be collected for free. Mixed material could be tagged, and if not
removed by the owner within a given time period, be collected for a fee. This could
significantly reduce disposal costs, as the majority of materials could go to source
separated processing facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Segregate waste</strong>: Dedicate resources towards segregating waste at
curbside prior to commingling during collection. The City of Los Angeles initially
collected waste, as is, at the curbside. Unfortunately, a small amount of contamination,
such as wood in a pile of concrete rubble, would require the entire load to go to a mixed
waste disposal facility or recycling facility. The resulting tip fee would be considerably
more than that at a segregated processing facility. </p>

<p>The City then began using crews to pick through piles of debris that had slight
commingling of waste to produce individual piles of separated waste that could be hauled
to source separated facilities at a reduced disposal cost. </p>

<p><strong>Suggestion</strong>: Any jurisdiction that is considering using this type of
manpower should investigate the potential use of crews from the California Conservation
Corps (CCC) or the Employment Development Department (EDD). </p>

<h2><a name="sseven">Step</a> 7: Identify temporary storage areas </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Determine need for temporary storage areas</li>
  <li>Develop criteria for siting temporary storage or pre-staging areas.</li>
  <li>Make a list of all possible sites: public and private</li>
  <li>Consider pre-approving sites and receiving permit in advance, to be activated upon
    declaration of disaster/emergency.</li>
  <li>Identify permit and environmental compliance requirements and time needed to process.</li>
  <li>Decide the type and level of environmental assessment and monitoring needed to be
    performed at site.</li>
  <li>Negotiate in advance the use or lease of public or private land.</li>
  <li>Develop Site Operation Plan.</li>
  <li>Develop Site Restoration Plan.</li>
</ul>
<strong>

<p>More information:</strong> Refer to Chapter 4, Temporary Storage Sites, for information.</p>

<h2><a name="seight">Step 8</a>: Identify/establish markets for 
collected materials</h2>

<p><strong>Identify end-uses and markets: </strong>

<ul>
  <li>Determine end-uses and market specifications fordisaster debris.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>List the local brokers and processors, materials they handle, and end-uses.</li>
    <li>Identify market specifications for the selected end-uses.</li>
    <li>Identify processing requirements for selected end-uses.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Identify potential markets.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>List the existing markets.</li>
    <li>If located in or near a Recycling Market Development Zone, list the recycling businesses
      within the Zone, the secondary materials they accept and process, and the end-products.</li>
    <li>List local, state, and national waste exchanges available.</li>
    <li>Identify potential projects within your city/county programs for materials collected
      (e.g., parks, public works).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Identify markets still needed after evaluating existing, available markets for materials
    and quantities projected.</li>
  <li>Identify market barriers.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information: Refer to Chapter 2, Pre-disaster Assessment, for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="snine">Step</a> 9: Determine contract requirements</h2>

<p><strong>Negotiate beforehand</strong>: Although contract negotiations may not occur
until after a disaster occurs, it is important to select the type of contract that meets
your needs best. This is also the mechanism through which a jurisdiction can ensure that
diversion activities are included in the program.</p>

<p><strong>Sample contracts</strong>: Chapter 5, Contracts, contains excerpts from five
contracts that have incorporated diversion language into the contract provisions.

<ol>
  <li>City of Santa Clarita cleanup contract, 1994 Northridge Earthquake;</li>

</ol>

<p>In addition several sample contracts are included as attachments to Chapter 5, which
can be used as a guide. They include sample contracts developed by FEMA .</p>

<p><strong>Review existing contracts</strong>: A jurisdiction should review its existing
contracts to determine if there are any relevant provisions dealing with disaster debris
or if the contract can be used as the vehicle to provide emergency cleanup work, either as
written or modified. </p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: Refer to Chapter 5, Contracts, for more specific
information.</p>

<h2><a name="sten">Step 10</a>: Develop tracking/documentation system</h2>

<p><strong>Document</strong>: Documentation is necessary to verify the program is being
implemented in the fashion envisioned and to make program changes as needed. Moreover,
adequate documentation is necessary to obtain reimbursement from FEMA. </p>

<p><strong>FEMA policy</strong>: FEMA policy states that it will reimburse the least cost
method of waste removal. However, if a jurisdiction can document that there is an existing
policy or that the governing body has taken official action that mandates recycling or
diversion, FEMA may be more likely to reimburse costs for locally approved procedures. A
debris management plan</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is possible to recycle at a lower cost than disposal as proven by
documentation by the City of Los Angeles following the Northridge earthquake (see
Attachment B in Chapter 6).</p>

<p>The City of Los Angeles used an authorization letter to encourage haulers to take the
materials to a recycling facility.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Document time and cost expenditures. This is extremely
important if a jurisdiction anticipates reimbursement from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. Comprehensive documentation of all expenditures related to addressing a
disaster is necessary for reimbursement through FEMA.</p>

<h2><a name="seleven">Step 11</a>: Develop public information 
strategy/program</h2>

<p><strong>Advertise program</strong>: Notify residents of program. This point may seem
obvious, but there are several potential barriers to disseminating information on a
curbside pickup program. A City's public outreach program should evaluate all forms of
media including: newspaper ads, radio public service announcements, and television public
access stations. Be aware of communities where multiple language ads will be necessary.
Also, be prepared to pay for the ads. The City of Los Angeles was quoted a price of
$16,000.00 for a one-day quarter-page ad in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Coordinate with OES</strong>: Also be sure to coordinate the dissemination of
information on diversion programs with your public information office and the Office of
Emergency Services public information effort.</p>

<p><strong>Public ed</strong>: Finally, the jurisdiction must determine the length of the
curbside program, as well as the method of informing the public. If the program is to
cease on a given date, adequate resources must be spent informing the public. </p>

<p>Additional thought must be given towards any non-English speaking sectors of the
jurisdiction, as well as the visually or physically impaired, to inform them of the
program implementation and conclusion. For example, the City of Los Angeles used the Good
Year Blimp to advertise the end of their curbside program. (See Chapter 17 for a case
study of the City of Los Angeles' Northridge earthquake response for more information). </p>

<p><strong>More information</strong>: Also, refer to Chapter 10, Household Hazardous Waste
Collection Program.</p>

<h2><a name="stwelve">Step</a> 12: Develop methods to encourage diversion</h2>

<p><strong>Incentives</strong>: Institute incentive for haulers. City staff indicated that
one of the most difficult aspects of the program was both educating the haulers on the
preferable sites to haul the material to and then ensuring that they followed through on
the instructions. As indicated above, the City placed recycling facilities in higher
preference to mixed disposal facilities. However, the recycling facilities may not be the
most preferable facility in the hauler's mind. </p>

<p>The hauler may have chosen a facility based on distance, familiarity, or absence of
truck scales on route rather than recyclability of material or disposal cost as the City
bore the brunt of these costs. </p>

<p>The City developed a training guide entitled &quot;Northridge Earthquake Recycling
Requirements for C-21 Contractors,&quot; which lists the City's requirements, materials
specifications, and recycling and disposal facilities. All haulers were given the manual
and trained on program guidelines. </p>

<p><strong>See page</strong>: Refer to Chapter 2, Pre-disaster Assessment, for more
information.</p>

<h2><a name="sthirteen">Step</a> 13: Develop monitoring and enforcement program</h2>

<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Even with the training, the City needed to constantly
police the haulers to verify that the loads were taken to the preferred locations. An
attempt was made to designate a primary disposal/recycle location on a ticket to be
presented to the facility operator. </p>

<p>If the load was rejected, or the facility was full, the ticket would be stamped at the
facility and the load was to be taken to the next facility listed. </p>

<p>This was only partially successful. In some cases the drivers changed the location
listed on the tickets avoiding the hierarchy altogether. This process is also very
resource intensive, as inspectors are needed at each cleanup site prior to hauling to mark
the tickets. </p>

<p><strong>Incentive</strong>: In conclusion, the City felt the method that had the most
potential for success in ensuring that the high priority facilities (recycling) were
visited first, involved some sort of incentive program. </p>

<p>If the drivers received some sort of perk for adhering to the criteria, more material
would be recycled, and a great deal of money would be saved in the form of reduced tipping
fees and reduced staff time dedicated towards policing cleanup crews and haulers.</p>

<p><strong>Inspectors</strong>: Continual oversight by inspectors is needed. As discussed
in the previous item, oversight is needed to ensure that the hauler goes to the preferred
facility. Additional oversight is needed for the crews loading the debris to ensure that
material separation techniques are used. </p>

<p>Inspectors, or incentive programs, are needed to ensure that full loads are taken to
the processing facilities rather than half empty trucks. Under the City's initial system,
there was no incentive for a hauler to completely fill a truck before going to the
disposal/recovery facility. The haulers were paid for their time rather than by weight.
The City determined that it was necessary; otherwise, there would be no incentive to haul
low-density materials such as wood and insulation.</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong>: Refer to Chapter 17 for two case studies of curbside
collection of disaster debris after the 1994 Northridge earthquake--City of Los Angeles
and City of Santa Clarita.</p>

<h2><a name="sfourteen">Step</a> 14: Prepare final report</h2>

<p><strong>Why needed</strong>: A final report of program activities and results may be
required for FEMA reimbursement for diversion programs implemented. This report allows
jurisdictions to evaluate program success and areas for improvement and is crucial for
future disaster debris planning purposes. </p>

<p><strong>Major topics</strong>: The Final Report's major topic areas are presented below
as an example of the types of program information that should be collected.

<ul>
  <li>program goals;</li>
  <li>operational approach;</li>
  <li>facilities used;</li>
  <li>program costs for tipping fees: recycling and disposal facilities; contractors (C-21 for
    debris removal/loading, and trucking);</li>
  <li>landfill space savings;</li>
  <li>tonnage and % of materials recycled and disposed of;</li>
  <li>recycling rates by material type;</li>
  <li>program costs by ton - recycling compared to disposal;</li>
  <li>demonstrated program effectiveness; and</li>
  <li>lessons learned and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>
