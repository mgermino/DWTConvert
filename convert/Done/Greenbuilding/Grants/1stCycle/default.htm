    approved staff&#146;s recommendation to fund the <a href="nofa.htm">first cycle of the Sustainable Building
    Grant Program</a>. </p>

    <p>The Board received a total of 16 applications and recommended 11 for funding,
    totaling $492,684. The distribution of funds was closely split between program and
    construction projects, with the Board funding seven <a href="#Program">program projects</a>
    and four <a href="#Construction">construction projects</a>. </p>

    <p>The construction projects ranged from development of a facilities plan to 
    the actual construction of a building. The program projects were more 
    focused on guideline development, workshops and educational outreach 
    efforts.</p>

    <h2>Grant Project Summaries, Deliverables and Photos </h2>
    <p>The following jurisdictions received grant funds to develop or expand 
	their green building programs, or design and construct a sustainable

    <h2><a name="Orange">County of Orange</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Description of project:</strong> The sustainable building grant provided funding for
    indoor air quality testing (pre- and post-construction), preparation of educational
    materials to promote green building practices, and green building award applications.
    ($33,767)</p>
    <p><strong>Project update:</strong> The County experienced numerous delays on their new green 
    building at the Frank R. Bowerman landfill. Due to these delays the county 
    was only able to do pre-construction air quality testing during the grant 
    term. They also met some resistance from inspectors and the building 
    department in trying to incorporate some of the green materials and 
    techniques originally planned for use in the building. However, they were 
    able to get some of the sustainable materials and techniques into their new 
    facility, and develop a <a href="OCBrochure.pdf">brochure</a> (PDF, 2MB) detailing those materials. This brochure 
    will provide the public with information on what sustainable 
    materials/techniques were incorporated and their benefits to the building 
    occupants and the surrounding environment.</p>
