    <h2><a name="Ventura">Ventura</a> County</h2>
    <p><strong>Description of project:</strong> These funds were to be used for construction
    costs to incorporate green building and recycled-content materials.&nbsp;
    They were also to cover a demonstration project to fund additional costs of
    incorporating sustainable building concepts and allow for tours and public
    outreach. ($56,285.84)</p>
    <p><strong>Project update:</strong> The Ojai Foundationï¿½s Gateway Reception Center is the 
    first fully permitted straw bale building in Ventura County. This building 
    incorporated numerous sustainable building materials and techniques 
    including: fly ash in the concrete foundation and footings; recycled content 
    steel, roofing materials and denim insulation; recycled content and Forest 
    Stewardship Council (FSC) lumber; earthen plaster walls; and photovoltaic

    <p><strong>Description of project:</strong> Funds were to cover construction costs
    associated with using recycled-content materials in their newly remodeled
    city hall.&nbsp; The city was to develop a showcase of those materials, and pursue
    a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. ($27,000)</p>
    <p><strong>Project update:</strong> The proposed sustainable building project was not 
    completed during the grant term due to delays associated with the siting of 
    the new facility. The city intends to locate a new site for their city 
    offices; however, this wasnï¿½t possible during the grant term. Even though 
    the project hasnï¿½t fully come to fruition, the City Council and city staff 
    was able to get a better understanding of sustainable building principles 
    throughout the early stages of the grant term.</p>
