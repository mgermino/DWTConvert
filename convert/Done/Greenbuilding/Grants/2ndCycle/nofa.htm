<p>On October 20, 1999 the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)      
approved an allocation of $350,000 for the Sustainable Building Grants Program for Green      
Building Design and Construction Project Grants. All grants will be awarded on a      
competitive basis.</p>     
  
<p><strong>Funding<br />  
</strong>Due to a redirection of funding by the Board, up to $422,000 in grant funds will   
be available for this grant. The grant term is from December 1, 2000 through April 30,   
2003. Recipients will need to complete activities by the end of April 2003. This is a   
general solicitation, meaning there is no specified limit on the grant requests. </p>  
  
<p><strong>Eligibility<br />  
</strong>All cities, counties and local government agencies in California are eligible to   
apply for funding. Proposals must advance the use of green building design and   
construction practices in California. </p>

Only one (1) application per jurisdiction may be submitted for consideration in this grant

<p><strong>Priorities<br />  
</strong>The Sustainable Building Grant application requires that the applicant:   
  
<ul>

    to advance the use of green building practices; and</li>  
  <li>Describe any method that will be employed to measure results.</li>  
</ul>  
  
<p>The CIWMB has moved the Green Procurement Policy from preference criteria to general   
review criteria, and the point value was increased significantly. This was done in an   
effort to show the CIWMB�s commitment to green procurement. In order to receive points   
for having a Green Procurement Policy, applicants will need to:   
  
<ul>  
  <li>Provide proof of policy modified/adopted within the last 5 years (adoption of a policy   
    during the application period is acceptable);</li>  
  <li>Include evidence of implementation;</li>  
  <li>Include a discussion of the results of policy implementation; and</li>  
  <li>Include evidence of the use of re-refined oil in your vehicles.</li>  
</ul>  
  
<p>Forms, samples, and detailed instructions are included in the application package.</p>

</strong>Applicants must submit a resolution from the applicant's governing body, which   
authorizes the jurisdiction to submit the application. Resolutions are due by October 13,
