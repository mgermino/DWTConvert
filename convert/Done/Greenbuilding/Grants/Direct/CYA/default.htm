    <p class="ListIntro">The California Youth Authority (CYA) received a $150,000 direct grant 
    from the CIWMB at its
    <a href="/Agendas/agenda.asp?RecID=540&Year=2003&Comm=BRD&Month=4">Board meeting in April 2003</a>. 
	These grant funds were awarded for the incorporation of California waste 
	tire products into multiple youth facilities throughout the State. At the 
	end of the grant term, the CYA provided an evaluation to the Board 
	including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A summary of the various projects.</li>
      <li>A description 
    of the recycled content products used.</li>
      <li>An evaluation of the recycled 
    content and tire-derived building materials used in the products.</li>
      <li>A 
    description of both the positive and negative experiences CYA had with the 
      products. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The grant term ended on April 15, 2005.</p>
	<p><strong>Project Outcome</strong>: These funds were used to incorporate recycled 
	rubber products into four (4) youth facilities throughout the State of 
	California. The materials incorporated into these facilities were 
	Inter-locking recycled rubber matting. Applications for this product varied 
	from pool areas and showers to basketball courts and living units.</p>
	<p>The evaluation of these products, in most applications was positive; 
	however, CYA staff did find some issues when they used these products in 
	certain exterior applications. These were reported to include fading, being 
	too hot to walk on with bare feet in sunny conditions, and expansion and 
	contraction of the edges with changes of temperature. </p>
