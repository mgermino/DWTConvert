    <p><a href="../../../CaseStudies/Educational/CampArroyo.htm">Camp Arroyo Youth Camp and Environmental Education Center</a> is a facility 
    run through a collaborative effort between the 
    <a href="http://www.ttff.org/">Taylor Family Foundation </a>and
    <a href="http://www.ebparks.org/">East Bay Regional Park District</a>. Camp Arroyo was designed and built to 
    incorporate the principles and techniques of sustainability in a beautiful 
    and natural setting.</p>

    <p>The Board was fortunate to get to work with the Taylor Family Foundation 
    and the East Bay Regional Park District in this project. The Board provided $200,000 towards the cost of the 7,600 sq ft. dining hall. The 
    dining hall was constructed with bales of rice straw, sustainably harvested 
    lumber, and recycled steel. The ceiling has cellulose insulation (recycled 
    newspapers), and the energy efficient windows in the roof may be opened or 
    closed for climate control. Additional energy efficient materials and 
    techniques incorporated into this building include; maximized natural 
    daylighting; wood framed and dual paned windows; and high-efficiency water 
    heaters and lighting. Another exciting feature of this building is the 
    galvanized metal roof that allows for the collection of rainwater for 
    non-potable use throughout the camp.</p>

    <p class="ListIntro">Camp Arroyo is truly an environmental education center. The remaining 
    buildings on the property are also sustainably designed and constructed. 
    Some of the sustainable features of the cabins are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wood from managed forests</li>
      <li>Cement fiber board siding</li>
      <li>Cellulose insulation</li>
      <li>50 percent fly ash concrete</li>
      <li>Wheat straw wall paneling</li>
      <li>Daylighting</li>
      <li>Passive heating</li>
      <li>Natural ventilation</li>
      <li>Shading devices on the exterior windows</li>
      <li>Double paned, low-e glass windows</li>
      <li>Solar hot water heating</li>
      <li>Radiant space heating</li>
      <li>Evaporative cooling</li>
      <li>Recycled glass tile and countertops</li>
      <li>Galvanized metal roofs</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ListIntro">Additional environmental features include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A 3500 sq ft. fully accessible swimming pool with an ozone treatment 
      system to improve water quality and reduce chlorine use.</li>
      <li>A bath house with walls constructed of stabilized &quot;gunned&quot; earth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The youth camp also provides education on growing vegetables and herbs in 
    their very own garden, which the children help take care of when they are 
    there. The children who visit Camp Arroyo also enjoy art classes in the unique 
    setting of a modern yurt.</p>
