    The Board awarded the city of San Francisco a direct grant in the amount of 
	$25,000. This grant was to advance the use of California waste tires by 
	incorporating them into the construction of a public walkway in the Golden 
	Gate Concourse Underground Parking Facility. This facility was one of San 
	Franciscoï¿½s Green Building pilot projects and therefore, special attention 
	was to be given to ensure that the project was designed and constructed in 
	an environmentally sustainable and energy efficient manner. The grant 
	required the City to submit a final evaluation report to the CIWMB with the 
	following information:<ul>
		<li>Project summary</li>
		<li>Methods used to evaluate the success of the project</li>
		<li>A description of what green building and waste tire products were 
		used in the project</li>
		<li>An evaluation of the green building material and techniques 
		incorporated into the project</li>
		<li>A discussion of the successes, problems encountered and lessons 
		learned from the project</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Project Update</strong>: Due to numerous construction delays, the City was 
	unable to complete the project before the grant term expired on April 30, 
	2004.</td>
