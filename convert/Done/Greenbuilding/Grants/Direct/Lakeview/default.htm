    <p class="ListIntro">The <a href="../../../CaseStudies/Public/Lakeview.htm">Lakeview Terrace Branch Library</a> in the city of Los Angeles is an 
    exciting example of sustainable building. Some of the sustainable or &quot;green&quot; 
    features present in the library are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Natural daylighting</li>
      <li>Shading to filter 
    direct sunlight</li>
      <li>Solar panels</li>
      <li>Sensors that control indoor lighting for 
    improved energy efficiency</li>
      <li>A cooling tower</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This building also features 
    recycled content and environmentally preferable products, such as recycled 
    carpet tiles and bamboo flooring. The Board was able to provide $250,000, 
    for the incorporation of some of the sustainable features showcased in the 
    library. This facility opened to the public in June 2003.</p>

    <p class="ListIntro">The 10,700 square foot library was designed to minimize 
    its footprint and impact on the environment, while providing a much-needed 
    staple to the surrounding community. The library provides this Los Angeles 
    community a beautiful library with the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>40,000 new 
    books and videotapes</li>
      <li>Computers with Internet access</li>
      <li>A 
    multipurpose meeting room</li>
      <li>A small area in the library where teens can read</li>
      <li>A special area for storytelling to small children</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anyone who visits 
    this fabulous library also gets a chance to learn about the building and its 
    sustainable features through the environmental resource exhibit area. This 
    area illustrates and describes the materials and techniques incorporated 
    throughout the library and explains why these specific materials and/or 
    techniques were used.</p>

    <p>This project was very exciting to see come to fruition as it is touted as 
    the �most environmentally friendly building a city contractor has ever 
    constructed.� For more information on this project visit this
