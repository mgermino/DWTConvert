    <p>The California Department of Parks and Recreation received a contract, in 
	the amount of $153,600, for the purchase, installation, and performance 
	evaluation of sustainable building tire-derived products.</p>
	<p>These funds were awarded at the May 11-12, 2004 Board meeting, and the 
	term of the contract went until May 15, 2006.</p>
	<p>Under the terms of this Interagency Agreement (IAA) with California 
	Department of Parks and Recreation, these products will be installed in 
	various parks throughout the State of California, and the evaluation will 
	discuss the ease of product availability and installation, product 
	maintenance and durability, as well as park user satisfaction with the 
	various products.</p>
	<p><strong>Project Update</strong>: These grant funds provided an opportunity for the 
	use of various rubber products in multiple State Park locations throughout 
	the Southern Service Center region in southern California. The selected 
	Parks varied in climate and location, anywhere from the beach to the 
	mountains and the desert, and were therefore, a great study in how specific 
	products responded in various climates. There were over 100 installations of 
	14 different products throughout 43 different parks. These products were 
	procured from 6 vendors. They will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of 
	the products, as well as the responses received from staff and park 
	visitors, and will report that information to the Board in early 2007.</p>
