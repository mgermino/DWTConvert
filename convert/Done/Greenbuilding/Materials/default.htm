      <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>The concept of <a href="../Basics.htm">sustainable
      building</a> incorporates and integrates a variety of strategies during the design,
    construction and operation of building projects. The use of green building materials
    and products represents one important strategy in the design of a building.
      </p>
      <p>Green building materials offer specific benefits to the building owner and building
      occupants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced maintenance/replacement costs over the life of the building.</li>
        <li>Energy conservation.</li>
        <li>Improved occupant health and productivity.</li>
        <li>Lower costs associated with changing space configurations.</li>
        <li>Greater design flexibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Building
    and construction activities worldwide consume 3 billion tons of raw materials each year or
    40 percent of total <a name="global">global</a> 
       use <a href="#Roodman">(Roodman and
    Lenssen, 1995)</a>.  Using green building materials and products promotes conservation
    of dwindling nonrenewable resources internationally. In addition, integrating green
    building materials into building projects can help reduce the environmental impacts
    associated with the extraction, transport, processing, fabrication, installation, reuse,
    recycling, and disposal of these building industry source materials. </p>
    	<h2><a name="Material">What</a> is a green building product or material? 
		</h2>
    <p>Green building materials are composed of renewable, rather than 
	nonrenewable resources. Green materials are environmentally responsible 
	because impacts are considered over the life of the product <a href="#Spiegel">(Spiegel
    and Meadows, 1999)</a>. <a name="RossBack">Depending</a> upon
    project-specific goals, an assessment of green materials may involve an evaluation of one
    or more of the criteria listed below.</p>
    
		<h2><a name="Criteria">Green </a> building material/product selection
    criteria</h2>
      <p>This information was based on Lynn Froeschle's article, &quot;<a href="CSIArticle.pdf">Environmental 
		Assessment and Specification of Green Building Materials</a>&quot; (Adobe PDF, 1.4 
		MB), in the October 1999 issue of <i>
		<a href="http://www.csinet.org/s_csi/sec_specifier.asp?TRACKID=&CID=4&DID=4">
		The Construction Specifier</a></i>, a publication for members of the 
		Construction Specifications Institute (CSI). Selection criteria similar to what is
      presented below was also used for the East End Project as identified in the <a href="Review.htm">Review
      of Construction Projects Using Sustainable Materials.</a></p>
    <p><strong>Overall material/product selection criteria:</strong><ul>
      <li><a href="#Resource">Resource efficiency</a></li>
      <li><a href="#IAQ">Indoor air quality</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Energy">Energy efficiency</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Water">Water conservation</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Affordability">Affordability</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><a name="Resource">Resource</a> Efficiency </strong>
can be accomplished by utilizing materials that meet the following criteria:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recycled Content</strong>: Products with identifiable recycled content, including
          postindustrial
        content with a preference for postconsumer content.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural, plentiful or renewable</strong>: Materials harvested from sustainably managed
        sources and preferably have an independent certification (e.g., certified wood) and are
        certified by an independent third party.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource efficient manufacturing process</strong>:<strong> </strong>Products manufactured with resource-efficient processes including
        reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste (recycled, recyclable and
        or source reduced product packaging), and reducing greenhouse gases.</li>
      <li><strong>Locally available</strong>: Building materials,
        components, and systems found locally or regionally saving energy and
        resources in transportation to the project site.</li>
      <li><strong>Salvaged, refurbished, or remanufactured</strong>: Includes saving a material from
        disposal and renovating, repairing, restoring, or generally improving
        the appearance, performance, quality, functionality, or value of a
        product.</li>
      <li><strong>Reusable or recyclable</strong>:<sup> </sup>Select materials that can be easily
        dismantled and
        reused or recycled at the end of their useful life.</li>
      <li><strong>Recycled or recyclable product packaging</strong>: Products enclosed in
        recycled content or recyclable packaging.</li>
      <li><strong>Durable</strong>: Materials that are longer lasting or are comparable to conventional
        products with long life expectancies.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong><a name="IAQ">Indoor </a> Air Quality (IAQ) </strong>is enhanced
    by utilizing materials that meet the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Low or non-toxic</strong>: Materials that emit few or no carcinogens, reproductive
        toxicants, or irritants as demonstrated by the manufacturer
        through appropriate testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimal chemical emissions</strong>: Products that have minimal
        emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Products that also
        maximize resource and energy efficiency while reducing chemical
        emissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-VOC assembly</strong>: Materials installed with minimal VOC-producing compounds,
        or no-VOC mechanical attachment methods and minimal hazards.</li>
      <li><strong>Moisture<sup> </sup>resistant</strong>:<sup> </sup>Products and systems that resist moisture or inhibit the growth of
        biological contaminants in buildings.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthfully maintained</strong>: Materials, components, and systems that require only
        simple, non-toxic, or low-VOC methods of cleaning.</li>
      <li><strong>Systems or equipment:</strong> Products that promote healthy IAQ by
        identifying indoor air pollutants or enhancing the air quality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><a name="Energy">Energy</a> Efficiency </strong>can be maximized by
      utilizing materials and systems that meet the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Materials, components, and systems that help reduce energy
        consumption in buildings and facilities. (See <a href="../Basics.htm#Energy">Green Building
          Basics</a> for more information.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><a name="Water">Water</a> Conservation </strong>can be obtained by
      utilizing materials and systems that meet the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Products and systems that help reduce water consumption in
        buildings and conserve water in landscaped areas. (See <a href="../Basics.htm#Water">Green Building
          Basics </a>for more information.)</li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong><a name="Affordability">Affordability</a> </strong>can be considered when
    building product life-cycle costs are comparable to conventional materials
    or as a whole, are within a project-defined percentage of the overall
    budget. (See <a href="../Design/EnviroEcon.htm">Environmental and Economic
    Assessment Tools</a> for links to resources.)</p>
    	<h2><strong><a name="Three">Three</a>  basic steps of product selection</strong></h2>
    <p>Product selection can begin after the establishment of project-specific environmental goals.
    The environmental assessment process for building products involves three
    basic <a name="steps">steps</a>. <a href="#Lynn">(Froeschle, 1999)</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Research">Research</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Evaluation">Evaluation</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Selection">Selection</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>1. <a name="Research">Research</a>. </strong>This step involves gathering all
    technical information to be evaluated, including manufacturers' information such as
    Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) test data, product
    warranties, source material characteristics, recycled content data,
    environmental statements, and durability information. In addition, this
    step may involve researching other environmental issues, building codes, government
    regulations, building industry articles, model green building product specifications, and
    other sources of product data. Research helps identify the full range of the
    project&#146;s building material options.</p>
    <p><strong>2. <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation</a>. </strong>This step involves confirmation of the
    technical information, as well as filling in information gaps. For example, the
    evaluator may request product certifications from manufacturers to help sort out possible
    exaggerated environmental product claims. Evaluation and assessment is relatively simple
    when comparing similar types of building materials using the environmental criteria.
    For example, a recycled content assessment between various manufacturers of medium density
    fiberboard is a relatively straightforward &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparison.
    However, the evaluation process is more complex when comparing different products
    with the same
    function. Then it may become necessary to process both
    descriptive and quantitative forms of data. </p>
    <p>A life cycle assessment (LCA) is an evaluation of the
    relative &quot;greenness&quot; of building materials and products. LCA addresses
    the impacts of a product through all of its life stages. Although rather simple in
    principle, this approach has been difficult and expensive in actual practice
    (although that appears
    to be changing). </p>
    <p>One tool that uses the LCA methodology is BEES (<strong>B</strong>uilding for <strong>E</strong>nvironmental
    and <strong>E</strong>conomic <strong>S</strong>ustainability) software. It allows users to balance the
    environmental and economic performance of building products. The software
    was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's
    Building and Fire Research Laboratory and can be <a
    href="http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/bees.html">downloaded free on their Web
    site</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>3. <a name="Selection">Selection</a></strong>. This step often involves
    the use of an evaluation matrix for scoring the project-specific environmental criteria.
    The total score of each product evaluation will indicate the product with the highest
    environmental attributes. Individual criteria included in the rating system can be
    weighted to accommodate project-specific goals and objectives.</p>
