	<p><strong><a href="Specs/Section01350/METStudy.htm">Building Material Emissions 
	Study</a></strong>. CIWMB commissioned study that utilized the
	<a href="Specs/Section01350/default.htm">Section 01350</a> indoor air 
	quality testing protocols to measure emissions of products common to 
	classrooms and State construction in comparison to alternative products.
    Have you heard claims that recycled products may contribute to poor indoor 
    air quality? The <i><a href="/Publications/default.asp?pubid=1027">Building 
    Material Emissions Study</a></i> is now available to give you the scientific 
    evidence to dispels those myths and prove that there are low-emitting 
    recycled-content products that contribute to healthy indoor environments. 
    While most recycled-content products performed about the same as standard 
    products, some may need further refinement and testing before they can be 
    promoted for wide use indoors, and others are lower emitting.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="Designing">Designing</a> With Vision: A Technical Manual
      For Material Choices In Sustainable Construction.</strong><em> </em>This
      guide addresses why you should choose sustainable design. <i>Designing
      with Vision</i> includes information on choosing, locating and purchasing
      recycled-content building products. It also provides sample contract
      language and recycled-content building product specifications. <i>Designing
      with Vision</i> offers green building case studies. In addition, it
      provides strategies for reusing and reducing construction materials and
      managing job site waste.</p>

      <a href="/Publications/default.asp?pubid=1076">Designing Building Products Made With Recycled Tires</a></strong> was developed in 
      order to provide technical information on physical tire properties for 
      designers of buildings who use tire-derived products. Includes 
      cross-section illustration of a tire and appendix listing tire-derived 
      building and landscape products. Published by the California Integrated 
      Waste Management Board.</p>
    <p><a href="Design/CostIssues.htm"><strong>Life Cycle Costing Study.</strong></a> The 
	Integrated Waste Management Board joined with the State and Consumer 
    Services Agency, the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development 
    Commission, Air Resources Board, California Department of Transportation, 
    Division of the State Architect, and the Department of Water Resources to 
    develop a methodology for analyzing the cost effectiveness of sustainable 
    building strategies and features. </p>
    <p>This study was a key step in implementing Executive Order D-16-00 
    which required the State to integrate sustainable building practices into its 
    capital outlay design, construction, and operations processes. 
    Unfortunately, like many other governmental and private builders, the 
    State�s current capital outlay process primarily focuses on the building�s 
    &quot;first cost&quot; without much regard to long-term operations and maintenance 
    costs. Often, these long-term operations and maintenance costs have 
    significant impacts on the State�s budget. This study is anticipated to 
    provide data supporting the contention that the use of life-cycle costing 
    will achieve lower total costs throughout the life of the building. </p>
	<h3>Tire-Derived Resilient Flooring Study</h3>
	<p>While tire-derived resilient flooring is recommended for large spaces 
	such as auditoriums and boardrooms, the Building Material Emissions Study 
	concluded that these products needed further testing before they could be 
	promoted for wide-use indoors. As a follow-up to this study, the CIWMB 
	funded a Tire-Derived Resilient Flooring Study. The Office of Environmental 
	Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) developed indoor reference exposure levels 
	(iRELs), which are safe levels chemical emissions cannot exceed, to provide 
	guidance on how these products can contribute to healthy indoor living, 
	working, and schools environments. The emissions testing was completed in 
	May 2006. But, staff is working with the Department of Health Services and 
	OEHHA to finalize a report on the project, which is expected to be available 
	in December 2006. </p>
