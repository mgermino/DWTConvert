    <p>As homes age, one of the major replacements undertaken is your HVAC 
	system. There are a number of things to consider when replacing or upgrading 
	your HVAC system. HVAC replacement can be a daunting and expensive task, so you 
	should not rush into decisions that you might regret later.</p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Heating and cooling accounts for approximately 44 
	percent of your home's energy consumption. To reduce your monthly 
	utility bill, consider choosing an HVAC system that is as efficient as 
	possible within your budgetary constraints. The following resources will 
	help:</p>

		Best Practices Guide for residential HVAC retrofits</a>. U.S. Department 
		of Energy.</li>

		<a href="http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/videos/consumer/index.html">
		Training Videos for Energy Professionals</a> series offers videos on a 
		number of subjects including, &quot;What to look for in designing and 
		building the most energy efficient HVAC system possible.&quot;</li>

	<h2>Air Conditioners</h2>
	<p>When selecting a new air conditioning unit there are two major factors to 
	consider: efficiency and size. To determine the efficiency of an air 
	conditioner look for its SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating. The 
	higher the SEER rating the more efficient the unit, with SEER 12 or above being 
	considered energy efficient. National data shows that you can save $121/year 
	by replacing a SEER 8 unit with a SEER 13.</p>
	<p>The second factor to look at is size, generally listed in tons. People 
	commonly install a bigger unit than is required to cool your space thinking 
	that it must cool better. This, unfortunately, is not necessarily the case. 
	When a unit is oversized it tends to cycle more and thus be less energy-efficient. Oversizing may only cost 
	you an additional $10/year in utility 
	costs, but the correct, smaller unit should cost less to purchase.</p>
	<p class="ListIntro">The following resources will provide more information about 
	air 
	conditioners:</p>

	</ul>
	<h2>Ducts</h2>
	<p>Your HVAC system is only as good as the ducts that deliver the 
	warm or cool air to the living spaces. Many home's air ducts are prone to 
	leaks, so conditioned (heated or cooled) air escapes into the attic, crawl space, or 
	basement. Sealing ducts will make your system more efficient by preventing 
	that air from escaping. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Current 
	California energy code also requires that ducts be insulated to prevent heat 
	loss or gain, as it is very inefficient to move conditioned air through 
	ducting 
	without insulation.</p>

	</ul>
	<h2>Ventilation</h2>
	<p>As homes become better sealed to prevent air leakage (drafts), they also 
	become less efficient at providing adequate ventilation. Ventilation is 
	important as fresh air needs to be brought into your home to replace the 
	exhaled carbon dioxide. 
	Ventilation is also very important to reduce the concentration of toxic 
	chemicals that are present in many building and consumer products. 
	Ventilation can also reduce the risk of mold or mildew growth when moisture 
	is &quot;trapped&quot; inside of a tightly sealed home.</p>
	<h2>Utility Rebate Programs</h2>
	<p>Many utility companies offer various rebate programs for energy-efficient 
	HVAC components as well as other energy-efficiency measures. The Flex Your 
	Power website provides a searchable database of
	<a href="http://www.flexyourpower.com/res/tools/rgl.html">
	rebates, grants, and loans</a> offered by the various utilities.</p>
