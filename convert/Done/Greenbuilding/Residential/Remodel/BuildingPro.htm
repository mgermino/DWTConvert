    <p>Selecting a building professional that has green building experience, and 
	having them involved in your project from the beginning, is one of the most 
	important keys to ensure your project 
    successfully achieves both your environmental and economic goals.</p>

    <h2>Look For Green Building Experience</h2>

    <p>If your project requires the use of an architect, engineer, contractor, 
    landscape architect, or other building professional, choose professionals 
	who have some demonstrable level of green building knowledge or experience. 
    Professionals that have a working understanding of green building will 
    be more likely to deliver the green project that you are looking for and will not need a 
    big &quot;learning curve&quot; to able to effectively and efficiently incorporate the measures 
    that you want for your project. When interviewing prospective building 
    professionals, ask about their background, their philosophy 
    (architects), have them describe their green building experience, and ask 
	for a list of 
    references and green projects they've worked on that you can visit.</p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Several resources are available to help you find&nbsp;professionals with 
	green building experience:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://build-green.org/">Bay Area Build It 
		Green</a> has compiled a
		<a href="http://www.stopwaste.org/docs/cgbps_1-24-05.pdf">list of 
		certified green building professionals in the Bay Area 
		</a>(Adobe PDF, 78.6 KB).</li>
		<li>
		<a href="https://www.usgbc.org/AboutUs/MemberList.aspx?CMSPageID=91&CategoryID=1&">

		<li>
		<a href="http://www.greenhomeguide.com/index.php/service/C155/">
		GreenHomeGuide</a> lists building professionals in Northern 
		California.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>Employing green building techniques is sometimes perceived as being 
	significantly more costly than using standard building practices.
    <a href="../../Design/CostIssues.htm">Several studies</a> have shown that 
    green building need not exceed more than 5 percent of the cost of traditional 
    building. Often, the added costs of green building can be attributed to 
    either the building professional's inexperience with green building or 
    because the green building measures were added late in the process.</p>

    <h2>Choose a Reputable Professional</h2>
	<p class="ListIntro">Regardless of the profession, it is important to obtain and check 
	references and state licenses. Checking the license(s) will ensure 
	they are up-to-date and may flag any complaints from previous projects. Ask 
	your friends, family members, and neighbors for references and check the 
	references provided by the building professional(s) you are considering.</p>
