	design or building &quot;green&quot; is an opportunity not only to use our resources 
	more efficiently while creating healthier commercial or industrial 
	buildings, it also applies to residential construction and&nbsp; renovation.</p>
	<p>
    Residential green 
    building practices include designing and constructing homes that use 
    energy, water, and materials efficiently; have a reduced impact on their 
    physical environment; and promote a healthy indoor environment for you, your 
	family, or your customer. By using an 
    integrated design approach, the whole residential building can be designed and operated 
    as a system.</p>

	<h2>Why Build Green?</h2>

    <p class="ListIntro"><strong><a name="Benefits">Benefits</a> Of Green Building<br />
	</strong>Green building has multiple direct environmental and economic benefits to 
    consumers and to society as a whole. Some of these benefits include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Increasing demand for recycled content building products creates 
		markets for the feedstock collected in municipal recycling programs.</li>
      <li>Reducing and recycling construction wastes directly benefit local 
		jurisdictions working to meet the diversion requirements of AB939.</li>
		<li>Recycling construction waste is often less expensive than disposal.</li>
      <li>Making homes more energy efficient, California residents can realize 
		actual monthly utility savings.</li>
      <li>Including onsite electricity generation, via photo-voltaic cells or 
		other methods, reduces the state�s dependence on out-of-state power 
		generation, provides electricity back to the grid during the day, saves consumers money, and reduces air-pollution.</li>
      <li>Using low-flow water fixtures and reducing the amount of landscape can 
		reduce water demand, and, in areas with meters, will save consumers by 
		lower monthly bills.</li>
		<li>Cities that embrace green building can reduce the impacts on their 
		infrastructure including roads, water treatment, and storm water 
		run-off.</li>
      <li>Reducing water consumption also saves electricity used to pump water 
		to consumers.</li>
      <li>Increasing the use of infill land and/or encouraging redevelopment in 
		underutilized sites reduces 
      the consumption or farmland and eases transportation 
      burdens since these sites are generally located in developed areas near 
      jobs and services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ListIntro"><strong>Housing's Environmental <a name="Impacts">Impacts</a></strong><br />
	Population growth and housing development have many impacts on the 
    environment and on quality of life issues. The sheer number of existing housing units as well as the 
    potential impact of future growth in the state directly speaks to the need 
    of an integrated green building approach to housing. Among some of the 
    direct factors that impact California include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In 2002, California had approximately 12.4 million existing housing 
      units, nearly 70 percent having been built more than a quarter century 
		ago.</li>
      <li>In order to meet expected population growth, approximately 220,000 
		housing units will need to be added annually until 2020.</li>
      <li>The construction of a 2,000 ft<sup>2</sup> house generates 
		approximately 3.5 tons of waste.</li>
      <li>The residential sector accounts for roughly 31 percent of the 
		electricity consumed in the state.</li>
      <li>Transportation issues in California will become more acute as we 
		continue to build houses on cheaper land further from the economic 
		centers of the state.</li>
      <li>California residences use 5.6 million acre-feet of applied water 
		annually.</li>
      <li>American�s spend an average on 90 percent of their time indoors, and many 
      common building products used in housing construction emit formaldehyde or 
      other chemicals known by the state to have health impacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently, houses in California must be built to the most stringent 
    energy code in the country, but this will not be enough to reduce the 
    impacts housing has on the state�s environment. In order to be truly 
    effective, an integrated approach to building must be pursued. </p></td>
