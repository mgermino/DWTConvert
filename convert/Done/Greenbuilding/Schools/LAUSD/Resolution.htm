<p><strong>Whereas,</strong> Students learn best in an environment that is comfortable, healthy,  
naturally lit and well maintained, and studies have indicated that student achievement is  
greater and attendance higher when these conditions are met;</p> 
<p><strong>Whereas,</strong> Most of Los Angeles Unified School District�s (LAUSD) schools are  
in need of renovation to reach this standard of comfort and efficiency, and over 150 new  
schools must be constructed during the next 5-10 years to accommodate the growing number of  
students served by the District;</p> 
<p><strong>Whereas,</strong> Schools spend a substantial amount on energy costs each year, and  
studies show that energy costs for new facilities can be reduced by 25 percent;</p> 
<p><strong>Whereas,</strong> Building or renovating a school provides a unique opportunity to  
move beyond standard designs to create school facilities, whose tangible benefits have  
been measured in the form of increased student attendance, higher test scores, reduced operating  
costs, elevated teacher and staff retention, and an improved indoor environment by providing  
cleaner air, better acoustics, and natural light;</p> 
<p><strong>Whereas,</strong> An integrated design approach can often take advantage of energy  
savings that become feasible when the interaction between separate building elements, such as  
windows, lighting, and mechanical systems are considered; and</p> 
<p><strong>Whereas,</strong> The Blue Ribbon Citizens� Oversight Committee in Resolution No.  
2000-4 on September 27, 2000, recommended to the Board of Education that it mandate the  
development of comprehensive sustainable design criteria and the necessary implementation  
infrastructure for the construction of new and renovation of existing LAUSD schools and  
campuses; now, therefore be it</p> 
<p><strong>Resolved</strong>, That the Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles support the  
recommendations included in Resolutions No 2000-4 of the Blue Ribbon Citizens� Committee,  
and directs the head of the Facilities Division, in consultation with the Director of  
Environmental Health and Safety, to develop more resource efficient design criteria for use in the  
construction of new schools and the renovation of existing District schools and campuses; and be it</p> 
<p><strong>Resolved further</strong>, That the design criteria will be developed in consultation  
with the Collaborative for High Performance Schools and include such measures as site  
orientation, energy efficient envelope, lighting, and space conditioning; water  
efficiency; waste management; material resource efficiency; and heat island mitigation measures; and be it  
finally</p>
<p><strong>Resolved</strong>, That no later than 90 days after the adoption of this Resolution,  
staff present to the Board of Education a recommended High Performance Building Design and  
Implementation Plan including specific cost-benefit data, performance measures and a  
performance tracking mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of these measures.</p>
