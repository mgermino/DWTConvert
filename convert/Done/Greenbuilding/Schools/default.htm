    <h2><a name="Overview">What are high performance schools?</a></h2>      

    <p class="ListIntro">High performance schools join together the very best of today's design
    strategies and building technologies, as well as:</p>      
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a healthy and comfortable indoor environment.</li>
      <li>Conserve energy, resources, and water.</li>
      <li>Function as a teaching tool.</li>
      <li>Serve as a community resource for neighborhood meetings and functions.</li>
      <li>Ensure easy maintenance and operation.</li>
      <li>Create a safe and a secure educational atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Also, high performance
    schools are cost-effective and help to protect the environment.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><a name="K12">K-12</a> Schools</h2>      
    <p>In 2003, the California Department of Education estimated 35,000 new 
    classrooms or 7,000 classrooms per year (19 per day) are needed to 
    accommodate the projected number of unhoused K-12 students in the state. 
    Over the next five years, $5.2 billion per year in school funding will be 
    needed to design and construct nearly 300 schools annually in California. As 
    school expenses rise, it becomes even more important to find new ways to 
    minimize cost. High performance schools are an innovative and cost-effective 
    alternative in controlling operation and maintenance expenses.</p>      
    <p>Another challenge facing California's schools is the demand for improved student performance.
    High performance schools create a better learning environment      
    for children.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.h-m-g.com/projects/daylighting/summaries%20on%20daylighting.htm#Daylighting%20in%20Schools%20-%20PG&E%201999">Recent studies</a> show a direct link between high
    performance design features and increased test scores. To provide an optimum learning
    environment, it is      
    necessary to include high performance design concepts in the construction
    and modernization of California's schools.</p>

    (CHPS)</strong></p>
    <p>Organized in 2000, the <a href="http://www.chps.net">Collaborative
    for High Performance Schools</a> is a collaborative of government agencies, utilities, and nonprofits that are
    working to improve the quality of California's schools. CHPS is developing
    standards for the design and
    construction of high performance schools. As a part of the collaborative's activities,
    CHPS
    stakeholders provide funding to assist in the implementation of high
    performance features.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="ListIntro"> CHPS offers a
    <a href="http://www.chps.net/manual/index.htm">Best 
    Practices Manual</a> to assist architects, engineers, and school 
    administrators in designing and building schools that offer an enhanced 
    learning environment for children. CHPS Volume III, Criteria, provides a 
    checklist for schools to self-certify that they have achieved &quot;high 
    performance&quot; status. For information on school district's that are

<p> On February 
16, 2000, LAUSD's <u><font color="#666666">Sustainable 
Schools Workshop</font></u> (inactive) developed a sustainability plan for future district school 
facilities. A year later, the
Los Angeles City Board of Education unanimously adopted a <a href="LAUSD/Resolution.htm"> High Performance Schools
Resolution</a> formalizing their commitment to sustainable design. As part of that commitment,
LAUSD formed a High Performance Schools Work Group that has      
    been working with the <a href="#Collaborative">Collaborative for High 
Performance Schools</a> to develop design criteria so that all newly constructed
and renovated LAUSD schools are 
high performance schools. On February 28, 2003, LAUSD adopted another
<a href="http://www.chps.net/chps_schools/pdfs/LAUSD-Resolution-102703.pdf">
resolution</a> to reaffirm their commitment to design and construct high 
performance schools.</p>
