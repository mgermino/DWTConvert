	<h2>Environmental Specification Finalized</h2>  

<p>An&nbsp;interagency subcommittee of the Sustainable Building Task 
Force&nbsp;finalized&nbsp;a groundbreaking environmental specification for modular office 
furniture purchased under State contract. The specification sets new industry 
standards for indoor air quality, prescribes a high level of recycled content in 
components and packaging, bans CFCs and HCFCs used in foam production, and 
addresses energy-efficient task lighting designed for work stations. The 
environmental specification also requires manufacturers to carry out solid waste 
audits and prepare waste reduction plans at manufacturing facilities. <a name="1350">
This</a> benchmark modular furniture specification was the basis for developing 
Special Environmental Requirements (<a href="../Section01350/default.htm">Section 
01350</a>), an environmental specification that establishes sustainable building 
criteria and guides material selection.</p>

	<h2>Sustainable Modular Furniture 
	Competitively Priced </h2>           

<p>It is noteworthy that several modular furniture manufacturers participated in 
the bidding process and offered furniture products that met the stringent 
environmental requirements addressed in the&nbsp;specification at competitive prices. 
Significantly, the environmental specification helps explode the myth that 
environmentally friendly products cost more.</p>                       

<p>California has always been a leader in the environmental arena. As such, it 
is anticipated that the&nbsp;environmental&nbsp;specification&nbsp;for modular office 
furniture&nbsp;will serve as a model for other government and private sector entities 
throughout the country. </p>                      

	<h2>Contract Awarded </h2>           

<p> After an extensive review, the contract was awarded to Hon Industries on 
February 6, 2001.&nbsp; Hon Industries demonstrated compliance with all the 
major environmental provisions of the specification. The Department of General 
Services (DGS) estimates that the State will purchase up to $60 million dollars 
in office furniture products over the life of the contract&nbsp;between 
2001&nbsp;and&nbsp;2004. It is expected that the environmental specification&nbsp;for modular 
office furniture&nbsp;will live beyond the existing contract and will be re-evaluated 
and upgraded for future contracts. </p>
