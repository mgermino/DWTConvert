      <p>Working drawings and specifications are the essential
    working documents used by a contractor to bid and build a project. Standard building
    specifications are written documents that go with the drawings and describe the
    materials as well as the installation methods. They also prescribe the quality
    standard's of construction expected on the project.
      </p>
      <p>When specifying green building materials, it is best to follow the <a href="http://www.csinet.org">Construction
      Specifications Institute's</a> (CSI) <i>MasterFormat.�</i>&nbsp;
      Environmental goals for a specific project can easily be implemented into CSI
      <i>MasterFormat.�</i> The following Web Page will briefly explain CSI
      <i> MasterFormat�</i>
      and identify several areas to incorporate environmental specifications
      into a project. It will also outline the CSI <i> SectionFormat�</i> with a
      sample environmental specification, describe model specifications in
      general and provide links to some example environmental
      specifications.

    <h2><a name="CSI">CSI</a>   <i>  MasterFormat�</i></h2>
    <p>CSI standard formatting is used throughout the construction
    industry to format construction specifications in building contracts. The purpose of this
    format is to assist the user in locating specific types of information. Information
    contained in CSI&#146;s <i> MasterFormat�</i> is organized in a standardized outline form within 16
    divisions. Each division contains a number of sections. Each section is divided
    into three parts&#151;&quot;general,&quot; &quot;products,&quot; and
    &quot;execution.&quot; Each part is organized by a standardized system of articles and paragraphs.
    <a name="Spiegel" href="#Ross">(Spiegel &amp; Meadows, 1999)</a></p>
      <p>Green building specifications can be easily incorporated into CSI <i>
      MasterFormat�</i> in three general ways, as follows:</p>
    <h2><a name="Procedures">Environmental </a>Protection Procedures&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Division 1 is the area to dictate general administrative and procedural
      requirements as they apply to the entire project.&nbsp; Adding a section on Environmental Protection Procedures to Division 1
      offers a forum to state the project&#146;s environmental goals.&nbsp; This is the main section, often referred as Section 01350, where special
      environmental requirements can be identified.&nbsp; Environmental
      procedures can address resource efficiency, energy efficiency,
      &quot;healthy indoor air quality, environmental construction techniques,
      building component reuse, and construction recycling&quot; <a name="Froeschle" href="#Lynn">(Froeschle,
      1999).</a></p>
      <p>There are several other sections within Division 1 where environmental
      specifications should be included.&nbsp; For example, general requirements for
      recycled content levels can be included under Section 01610, Basic Product
      Requirements.&nbsp; In addition, a requirement for a Construction and
      Demolition (C&amp;D) Waste Management Plan can be submitted under Section
      01570, Environmental Controls.&nbsp; This section can also include a
      statement that requires contractors to talk about the C&amp;D Waste
      Management Plan at the pre-construction <a name="Berg Reference">conference</a>
      <a href="#Henry">(Berg, 2000)</a>.</p>
      <p>Aside from the environmental procedures section and other sections
      within Division 1, it is important to incorporate environmental
      specifications within all 16 CSI Divisions.</p>
    <h2><a name="Implementing">Implementing</a> Green Building
    Materials</h2>
      <p>Divisions 2 through 16 contain technical specifications for building
      materials,
    including material types and installation methods. Specifications that describe the unique
    product qualities of green building materials and products are often contained in these
      divisions. Environmental specifications are the attributes that support the
    project-specific environmental goals, such as low toxicity, minimal chemical
      emissions, recycled content, recyclability, durability, moisture
      resistance, and environmental and ecological installation procedures <a href="#Lynn">(Froeschle,
      1999)</a>.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> For example, if the project goals
    include the achievement of exceptional indoor air quality, certain product specifications
      may require minimum emission standards for toxic chemicals, such as
    volatile organic compounds (VOC) and formaldehyde. These material specifications may be specifically tailored to each
    specific building product or building material classification. The specifications must be
    grounded in real world conditions for building materials and products. For example, there is no point in writing a
    product specification that cannot be achieved by any building product manufacturer. </p>
    <h2><a name="Practical">Practical</a> Application of Environmental
    Specifications</h2>
      <p>Another application of environmental specifications includes addressing the installation,
    protection, handling and cleanup of specific building materials (even conventional
    products). They ensure that work is performed in a manner consistent with the
    environmental goals of the project. The incorporation of a green material alone may not
    contribute to &quot;greening&quot; the project if it does not function as intended due to
    improper installation or if it becomes contaminated as the result of careless handling. </p>
    <p>Project specifications should be reviewed in detail to evaluate the need for
    environmental procedures where applicable, and to determine if certain procedures are in
    conflict with project goals and the general environmental requirements listed in
    Division
    1. </p>

      <p>Figure 1 was excerpted from Lynn Froeschle's article titled,
      &quot;Environmental Assessment and Specification of Green Building
      Materials,&quot; in the October 1999 issue of <i><a href="http://www.csinet.org/specify/spechome.htm">The
      Construction

      <h2><a name="Sample">Sample</a> Green Specifications</h2>
    <p>Sample green specifications are available to help facilitate the development and application
    of environmental specifications. Most specifications are organized according to CSI
    Masterformat. Green specifications also can be used to benchmark the efficacy of other
    environmental specifications. </p>
    <p>Sample specifications are usually intended to supplement, not replace standard
    specifications. They are designed to be edited, adapted and incorporated into the standard
    specifications of a building project. Model green specifications generally augment standard
    specifications by providing additional environmental information, such as Sustainable
    Building criteria, definitions, and performance requirements. Below are references/links
    to sample green specifications, which are intended to provide general environmental guidelines
    for product selection, installation, and the handling of construction waste and demolition
    materials:</p>
