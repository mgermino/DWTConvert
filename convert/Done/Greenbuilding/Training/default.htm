    <p>Education and outreach are two of the priorities within the Department's 
	Sustainable Building program. The Sustainable Building program has primarily 
	focused its education efforts on construction waste management and building 
	material selection related to State construction and public school

	<p>Executive Order
	<a href="http://www.governor.ca.gov/state/govsite/gov_htmldisplay.jsp?sCatTitle=Exec+Order&sFilePath=/govsite/executive_orders/20041214_S-20-04.html&sTitle=Executive+Order+S-20-04">
	S-20-04</a> was signed on December 14, 2004 by Governor Arnold 
	Schwarzenegger renewing the State Of Californiaï¿½s commitment to sustainable 
	building design by requiring LEED Silver Certification for new and renovated 
	State buildings. The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery 
	(CalRecycle), which was formerly known as the Integrated Waste Management 
	Board, has been identified as lead in the Outreach and Education effort in 
	the draft Executive Order Implementation plan. </p>
	<p>Previously, in support of Executive Order D-16-00, the Department partnered 
	with Departmental of General Services to develop a series of educational 
	workshops designed to facilitate the incorporation of sustainable design 
	strategies into State construction projects. These trainings provided 
	introductory information on the following topics: Sustainable Design 
	Process; Site Selection; Energy; Indoor Environmental Quality; Indoor Air 
	Quality; Construction Waste Management; Sustainable Materials Selection; 
	Specifications and Operations and Maintenance. The <a href="State.htm">training materials</a>, developed in 
	partnership with HDR Architecture, Inc. and the Department of General 
	Services, are available in a downloadable format.</p>
	<h2><a href="LocalGovt/default.htm" name="Local">Local Government Education Programs</a></h2>
	<p>Sustainable Design training sessions have also been conducted on 
	developing local government green building programs and selecting 
	sustainable building materials.</p>
	<p>The Department has also provided funding, on a competitive basis, to support 
	local government sustainable building programs. For more information on 
	resources developed with these grant funds as well as other funding 
	opportunities please visit our <a href="../Grants/default.htm">grants page</a>.</p>
	<h2>Training For <a name="High_Performance_Schools">High Performance Schools</a> 
	in Partnership with CHPS</h2>
	<h3>Professional Design Trainings:</h3>
	<p>FREE all day CHPS Professional Design Training are tailored for project 
	managers, architects, engineers and the general public. The goal of this 
	training is to educate all attendees about the benefits of high performance 
	school construction as defined by the Collaborative for High Performance 
	Schools (CHPS).</p>
	<p>The training will give those involved in school construction the tools 
	and resources to design and build educational facilities that are safe, 
	healthy, efficient and provide the amenities for a quality education. The 
	training will begin with a general overview that identifies a CHPS 
	classroom, the benefits to utilizing the design guidelines and provide case 
	study examples.</p>
	<p>This is followed by a panel of experts who will present a breakdown of 
	design strategies that are defined in Volume II of the CHPS Best Practices 
	Manual. Case study examples will be provided and time will be allotted so 
	that attendees may ask questions. Each attendee will also receive a free set 
	of the CHPS Best Practices Manual. Six hours of Continuing Education AIA 
	Credits will be provided. CalRecycle staff provides expertise on sustainable 
	material selection and construction waste management at these trainings. For 
	upcoming trainings please visit the
	<a href="http://www.chps.net/events/workshops.htm#calendar">
	CHPS website</a>.</p>
	<h3>School District Officials CHPS Seminars</h3>
	<p>These free two-hour targeted sessions are tailored to the individuals who 
	oversee and approve the remodeling or new building process. The goal is to 
	provide decision makers with the tools and knowledge necessary to approve, 
	build and maintain high performance schools as defined by CHPS. For upcoming trainings please visit the
	<a href="http://www.chps.net/events/schoolDistSems.htm">CHPS 
	Website</a>.</p>
	<h2><a name="Other">Other</a> Education and Outreach Efforts </h2>
	<p>Other activities within the education program include partnering with 
	higher education institutions to integrate sustainable design into the 
	educational curriculum, conducting guest lectures on sustainable design, 
	making lunch time presentations, participating on conference panels, and 
	maintaining a sustainable design educational display booth that can be 
	displayed at trade shows and conferences.</p>
