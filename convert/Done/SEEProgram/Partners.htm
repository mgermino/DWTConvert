	<h2><a name="CDE">California Department of Education</a></h2>
	<p>The SEE Program established a partnership with the California Department of 
	Education (CDE), and its California Regional Environmental Education 
	Community Network.</p>
	<h2><a name="CREEC">California Regional Environmental Education Community Network</a></h2>
	<p>The goal of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creec.org">California Regional Environmental Education Community</a> (CREEC) 
	Network is to enhance the environmental literacy of 
	California K-12 students. To accomplish this mission, the CREEC Network 
	works collaboratively with the regional education community, local 
	governments, and environmental agency representatives to identify and 
	provide environmental education resources to teachers and students. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Through the SEE Program, the CREEC Network:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Outreaches to schools and school districts on environmental education, 
	particularly as it relates to energy. </li>
		<li>Coordinates regional energy education meetings, professional development 
	trainings, and events.</li>
		<li>Establishes new public and private partnerships that further the SEE 
	Program mission.</li>
		<li>Facilitate teachers� access to energy education materials.</li>
		<li>Work with other CDE divisions to integrate the SEE Program into their 
	activities.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="CIWMB">California Integrated Waste Management Board </a> </h2>
	<p>The School Diversion and Environmental Education Law (<a href="../SchoolDEEL/">School DEEL</a>, 
	Chapter 926, Statutes of 2001, SB 373, Torlaksen) establishes a number of landmark 
	changes in the way California�s education system views the area of 
	environmental education. Among other things, the law requires the 
	development of a unified strategy to integrate environmental education into 
	standards based K-12 curriculum. As a result, energy, water, waste, and air 
	issues will become an integral part of how students are taught math, 
	science, language arts, and other traditional subjects. The School DEEL process 
	will ultimately integrate a standards-based curriculum that incorporates 
	environmental education into every 6th grade classroom statewide. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Through the SEE Program, the California Integrated Waste Management Board 
	(CIWMB): </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implements an <a href="../Ambassador/Fresno/">Environmental Ambassador Pilot Program in Fresno Unified 
	School District</a> (FUSD). This program provides FUSD with professional 
	development and ongoing technical support for teachers, administrators and 
	school district business officials to allow them to effectively integrate 
	environmental management with California�s educational standards and adopted 
	textbooks. The outcome of this pilot program will be used throughout the 
	State as a model for the development of K-12 environmental education 
	programs.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="Arts">California Arts Council</a></h2>
	<p>The "Energy Education Through the Arts Grant Program" expands the California 
	Arts Council�s (CAC) art program activities in schools and communities. The 
	program presents an opportunity for artists in various disciplines (i.e., 
	visual arts, theatre, dance, music, literature, media arts) to develop 
	creative approaches to teach students about energy efficiency. Grant amounts 
	range up to $5,000 per recipient, depending on the type of artistic media, 
	level of project complexity, and community outreach potential. Projects 
	involve the production of murals, posters, theatrical pieces, songs, and 
	various other artistic forms, as a means of expressing what students are 
	learning about energy use and efficiency. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Through the SEE Program, CAC:</p>
