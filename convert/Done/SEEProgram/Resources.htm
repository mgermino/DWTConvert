	<h2><a name="ChampionGrants">SEE Program Champion Grants</a></h2>
	<p>School district personnel (i.e., teachers, principals, district staff, 
	facility operators) are a vital component of the School Energy Efficiency 
	program delivery system. Their efforts may involve managing energy 
	efficiency projects; attending SEE Program professional development 
	trainings; marketing program resources to district personnel and other 
	potential partners; and developing community energy education events. 
	Through the SEE Program, two school district representatives will be 
	identified as points of contact. These individuals are eligible for up to 
	$1,500 to assist them in their energy efficiency outreach, partnership 
	development, training, and technical assistance efforts. In all, the program 
	will award a maximum of 55 SEE Program Champion Grants to participating 
	school districts. </p>
	<h2><a name="AfterSchool">After School Grants</a></h2>
	<p>The SEE Program awarded three grants ($8,000/grant) to SEE Participating 
	school districts to fund energy efficiency and conservation activities in 
	existing after school programs aimed at providing expanded academic 
	enrichment opportunities for children through project based learning 
	activities. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Funding can be used for: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The purchase of energy education instructional materials.</li>
		<li>Professional development for after school staff in the areas of 
		energy conservation education.</li>
		<li>Creating after school activities related to energy 
		efficiency/environmental education activities.</li>
		<li>Monitoring and evaluation. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="Architect">Division of the State Architect</a></h2>
	<p>The Division of the State Architectï¿½s (DSA)
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sustainableschools.dgs.ca.gov/SustainableSchools/">
	newly upgraded website</a> serves as a comprehensive resource for SEE 
	Program participants. The website contains information on energy efficient 
	technologies; procurement specifications; links to utility, education 
	community, and other state agency websites; and a dense portfolio of 
	technical assistance information. </p>
	<p><strong>On-Line Video Tutorials. </strong>Through a partnership between the 
	Division of the State Architect and the California Energy Commission, the 
	SEE Program developed a series of energy efficiency on-line video tutorials 
	for school facility operators. This video tutorial series augments other SEE 
	Program facility improvement opportunities and services. Nine videos are 
	already completed and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.chpsvideos.com">
	www.chpsvideos.com</a>. </p>
	<h2><a name="Demonstration">Demonstration Projects</a></h2>
	<p class="ListIntro">Demonstration projects are an integral and important 
	component of the SEE Program. These projects provide opportunities to: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduce energy efficient technologies to district administrators 
		and facility staff.</li>
		<li>Integrate students and teachers into facility improvement 
		discussions.</li>
		<li>Use the school site as a teaching tool.</li>
		<li>Work with utilities, Rebuild America partners, as well as other 
		state and local partners. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>The SEE Program seeks opportunities to showcase a variety of different 
	energy efficient technologies, including, but not limited to, Energy Star 
	equipment, solar tubes, occupancy sensors, lighting upgrades, vending 
	misers, cool roofs, and high performance portable classrooms. </p>
