	<img border="0" src="../images/SEE.gif" width="96" height="92" alt="See Program Logo: 3 Overlapping circles with program name around the edge." align="right">To 
	fulfill its goals, the SEE Program is built on an extensive network of 
	partnerships with public, private, and nonprofit entities, which provide a 
	broad range of services to school districts in the SEE Program area. These 
	entities include the SEE Program Implementation Team as well as
	<a href="Partners.htm">many other partners</a>.</p>
	<p>The SEE Program Implementation Team is primarily responsible for 
	delivering energy education and facility improvement services to school 
	districts. The team is composed of several partners.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>ADM Associates</strong> provides the facility improvement services. ADM Associates, Inc. is a nationally recognized full service energy 
	consulting company with more than 20 years of experience in energy auditing, 
	benchmarking, energy conservation training and education, as well as 
	energy-efficient technology development.</li>
		<li><strong>The Alliance to Save Energy</strong> (ASE) provides the educational and 
	professional development services. ASE is a nonprofit coalition of prominent 
	business, government, environmental, and consumer leaders who promote the 
	efficient and clean use of energy worldwide to benefit the environment, the 
	economy and national security. The Alliance�s education, research, and 
	advocacy programs are concentrated largely in the education, building, 
	international policy, and communications areas.</li>
		<li><strong>Strategic Energy Innovations</strong> (SEI) is a nonprofit organization that works 
	in the areas of: energy use and efficiency, green buildings, economic 
	development, and sustainable communities. SEI has significant experience 
	assisting school districts improve the energy efficiency of their facilities 
	and administering energy education programs. SEI also works closely with the 
	Department of Energy�s Rebuild Program to aid school districts and 
	communities.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following lists some of the SEE Program Implementation Team services.</p>
	<p><strong>Educational Resources.</strong> The SEE Program provides grade-specific 
	instructional materials and activities correlated to California content 
	standards in science, math, and language arts. Educational materials are 
	compiled from such sources as the Alliance to Save Energy�s Green Schools 
	instructional resources binder, the U.S. Department of Energy�s Energy Smart 
	Schools program, the California Integrated Waste Management Board�s SB 373 
	environmental education lessons, and much more. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Examples of educational materials include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Hands-On Tools:</strong> Energy Education Tool Kits, containing devices 
		commonly used by energy professionals, allow students to collect data, 
		analyze results and prepare recommendations for improving the efficiency 
		of their school buildings.</li>
		<li><strong>Project-Based Learning Resources:</strong> Teacher guides and student 
		activities centered on implementing environmental education projects.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Films and Slide Shows:</strong> A collection of free communication media on 
		energy and sustainability issues.</li>
		<li><strong>Read, Read, Read:</strong> Colorful dinosaur-themed "Big Books" for younger 
		students and a nonfiction energy library for older students.</li>
		<li><strong>Professional Development:</strong> An 8-part course professionally designed 
		for elementary teachers on the science of energy. Through the workshops, 
		teachers receive professional development credits.</li>
		<li><strong>Interactive Mobile Energy Efficiency Labs:</strong> Through displays of 
		various energy efficient technologies, these labs offer participating 
		schools a fun, hands-on educational opportunity to learn more about 
		energy-efficiency. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Facility Improvement Services. </strong>Facility improvement services are 
	designed to provide comprehensive energy assessments of school district 
	buildings, as well as operations and maintenance training opportunities. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">Examples of such services include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Detailed Energy Audit:</strong> Low/no-cost energy efficient solutions are 
		recommended through extensive on-site energy audits. Participating 
		schools also receive assistance identifying rebate or other financial 
		incentive programs to implement the recommended solutions.</li>
		<li><strong>Training School Facility Staff:</strong> Facility staff receives training in 
		re-commissioning and maintenance of existing equipment (e.g., how to 
		check the refrigerant of HVAC units for proper charge, maintaining clean 
		filters and coils). </li>
		<li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> The energy consumption of school district facilities 
		is analyzed and evaluated against other similar facilities. As a result, 
		each school will be able to compare its energy usage against other 
		schools in the district, county or Central Valley.</li>
		<li><strong>Project-Based Learning Activities:</strong> Participating schools are 
		encouraged to promote the concept of the "school site as a teaching 
		tool." For example, activities that foster collaborations between 
		students and maintenance staff on lighting retrofits and HVAC system 
		upgrades can be incorporated into classroom instruction.</li>
		<li><strong>Demonstration Technology:</strong> Through partnerships with manufacturers, 
		trade associations, state, and federal agencies, some schools will be 
		provided demonstration technology to showcase the installation, 
		operation and maintenance of energy-efficient equipment.</li>
	</ul>
