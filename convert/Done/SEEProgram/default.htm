	<img border="0" src="../images/SEE.gif" width="96" height="92" alt="See Program Logo: 3 Overlapping circles with program name around the edge." align="right">The 
	School Energy Efficiency (SEE) Program provided a variety of energy 
	education resources and facility improvement services free of charge to 
	school districts located in the counties of Fresno, Kern, Kings, Tulare, 
	Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Yolo, El Dorado, and Mariposa. The 
	program components included: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Classroom, professional development, and project-based learning 
		activities designed to educate students, teachers, and school officials 
		about energy efficiency.</li>
		<li>School facility improvement services designed to provide facility 
		operators and administrators with technical assistance, demonstration 
		technology, and operation and maintenance training.</li>
		<li>Resources and activities that integrate the delivery of education 
		and facility improvement services to promote the concept of the "school 
		site as a teaching tool." </li>
	</ul>
	<p>SEE Program services were customized to fit the school districts� needs, 
	budget, and long-term strategic plans. To make this possible and keep track 
	of services provided to each district, the SEE Program staff developed a 
	district participation plan for each participating school district. These 
	plans served as a record of each district�s involvement in the SEE Program.
	</p>
	<p>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) awarded the California 
	State and Consumer Services Agency (SCSA) a $4.5 million grant to implement 
	the SEE Program. Upon approval of the CPUC, this grant program was 
	transferred from SCSA to the California Integrated Waste Management Board 
	(CIWMB), which concluded its administration of the SEE Program in December 
	2004. </p>
	<p class="ListIntro">In January 2005, D&amp;R International received a follow-up 
	grant from the CPUC to continue SEE Program activities. Information 
	regarding that program can be obtained by contacting: </p>
