The strategy for achieving the Sustainable Building goal is found in: <i>Building  
Better Buildings: A Blueprint for Sustainable State Facilities (Blueprint).</i>   Prior to drafting the <I>Blueprint</I>,       
      several agencies participating in the Sustainable Building Task Force       
      developed planning documents that complement the <I>Blueprint</I> and will       
      be used to advance the state goal.

Actions in the <I>Blueprint</I> are supported by various State                 
      mandates, however, compliance with many existing State statutes often falls                 
      short of the mark.&nbsp; A list is provided with links to more
