        <h2><strong><a name="WasteTracking">Disaster Waste Tracking</a></strong></h2>
        <p>Jurisdictions may deduct disaster waste tonnage in their annual reports to 
      the Board, so that it will not negatively impact their solid waste diversion rates. In 
      order for jurisdictions to be able to claim this disposal reduction, it is 
      very important that disaster waste be tracked at disposal facilities.</p>
        <p>Disaster waste needs to be tracked separately. For each disaster waste 
      load received, facilities need to record the tons by jurisdiction. 
      Applicable jurisdictions will need to be able to obtain an accounting that 
      shows how much disaster waste originated from their jurisdiction. If this 
      data is not tracked in this manner, it is very difficult for jurisdictions 
      to substantiate a disposal reduction and thus, negatively impacts their 
      ability to achieve their mandated diversion goals. </p>
        <p>Local government and emergency personnel have the most specific knowledge of areas that burned and facilities that are�or 
        soon will be�receiving disaster waste. We ask that you assist us in notifying all 
      applicable facilities regarding these record-keeping needs.</p>
