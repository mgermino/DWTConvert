	<p>In response to the devastating Southern California wildfires, the 
	California Integrated Waste Management Board has prepared the below 
	guidelines to assist local enforcement agencies (LEA) and local governments 
	with debris management and disposal, household hazardous waste collection 
	and storage, and ash cleanup and disposal. These guidelines will be updated 
	as more information becomes available.</p>

	<h2><a name="Debris">Disaster Debris Management</a></h2>
	<p>Guidance on disaster debris management, including selecting and securing 
	temporary storage sites, is available in
	<i>
        <a href="/LEAAdvisory/43/default.htm">Local Enforcement Agency Advisory #43--Disaster 
        Assistance</a></i>, as well as in the
	<a href="../DisasterPlan/default.htm">Disaster Plan</a>. LEA Advisory #43 
	also contains guidance on financial and technical assistance, as well as 
	information to collect for the CIWMB.</p>
	<h3><strong>For 
	Private Contractors</strong></h3>

	Project Specifications for the Angora Fire Structural Debris Removal--Lake 
	Tahoe, California</i></a> (Adobe PDF, 386 KB, dated July 16, 2007), is one 
	of two structural debris removal plans prepared by CIWMB for El Dorado 
	County. <a href="#Guidance">Other guidance documents</a> are listed further 
	below.</p>
	<h3><strong>For Local Governments Contemplating a Coordinated Debris Removal 
	Operation</strong></h3>
	<p>The document <i><a href="../AngoraFire07/DebrisRemoval/ScopeOfWork.pdf">Scope of Work for the Angora Fire Structural Debris Removal--Lake Tahoe, California</a></i> (Adobe PDF, 3.1 MB, dated September 15, 2007), was prepared by CIWMB for El Dorado County.</p>
	<p>The
	<a href="http://www.co.el-dorado.ca.us/Angora/pdf/RightofEntryPermit.pdf">
	right-of-entry permit</a> (Adobe PDF, 159 KB) allows counties, cities, and 
	state agencies to proceed with cleanup on privately owned 
	properties.</p>
	<p><strong>Disaster Waste Tracking:</strong> Jurisdictions may deduct disaster waste 
	tonnage in their annual reports to the Board, so that it will not negatively 
	impact their solid waste diversion rates. In order for jurisdictions to be 
	able to claim this disposal reduction, it is very important that disaster 
	waste be tracked at disposal facilities.</p>
	<p>Disaster waste needs to be tracked separately. For each disaster waste 
	load received, facilities need to record the tons by jurisdiction. 
	Applicable jurisdictions will need to be able to obtain an accounting that 
	shows how much disaster waste originated from their jurisdiction. If this 
	data is not tracked in this manner, it is very difficult for jurisdictions 
	to substantiate a disposal reduction and thus, negatively impacts their 
	ability to achieve their mandated diversion goals. </p>
	<p>Local government and emergency personnel have the most specific knowledge 
	of areas that burned and facilities that are--or soon will be--receiving 
	disaster waste. We ask that you assist us in notifying all applicable 
	facilities regarding these record-keeping needs.</p>
	<p>Please contact Charlotte Sabeh, supervisor in charge of disposal reporting 
	at (916) 341-6214 if you have questions on tracking disaster waste.</p>
