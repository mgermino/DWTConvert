<h2 align="left"><a name="UES">Unified</a> Education Strategy Grants</h2>

<p align="left">On May 14, 2003, the Board approved funding for the following 12 
school districts to receive a competitive Unified Education Strategy (UES) 
grant: Anderson Valley Unified, Belmont-Redwood Shores, Beverly Hills Unified, 
Chico Unified, Emery Unified, Etna Union Elementary, Hawthorne, MIT Academy, 
Pacific Unified, Petaluma City, San Carlos, and Los Angeles Unified (to include 
local districts A, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I). Mariposa County Unified School 
District will also participate in the UES thanks to a grant from the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scsa.ca.gov">State and Consumer Services Agency</a>.</p>

<p align="left">The principal goals of the Unified Education Strategy, as 
described in the legislation, are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>Coordinate instructional resources and strategies for providing 
active pupil participation with on-site conservation efforts.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Promote service-learning opportunities between schools and local 
communities.</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Assess the impact to participating pupils of the Unified 
Education Strategy on student achievement and resource conservation.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The grants are based on a two-cycle funding allocation. Cycle 
one, currently in progress, is for the districts to audit their campus 
resources, such as waste, energy, water, and air systems, and develop 
implementation plans based on their audit findings. Cycle two funding, to be disbursed 
in May 2004, would help the districts to implement their plans. The dollar 
amount per district is up to $27,000 in cycle one and up to $38,000 in cycle 
two.</p>

<h2><a name="Waste">Waste</a> Tire Track and Other Recreational 
Surfacing Grants</h2>

<p>The  Board is offering the
<a href="/Tires/Grants/TrackSurface/FY200304/Apply/NOFA.htm">Waste Tire Track 
and Other Recreational Surfacing Grant Program</a> for fiscal year 2003–04 to 
encourage the reduction of landfill disposal and stockpiling of California waste 
tires. The CIWMB will award grants on a competitive basis. Grant funding shall 
not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any jurisdiction. Public 
entities that operate and manage public recreational facilities in California 
may apply. Applications are now available. You may request the application by 
calling CIWMB's Grant Hotline at (916) 341-6441, or you may&nbsp;
<a href="/Tires/Grants/TrackSurface/">download the application</a>. The deadline 
for the application is Monday, November 3, 2003.</p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Worm">Worm</a> Bins and Compost Teas</h2>

<p>Kalamazoo, MI. Compost teas are one of the hottest things going 
out on the west coast, ranging from California to Alaska. These brews are full 
of beneficial microbes that can put life back into soil that has had its 
life-giving qualities removed by excess applications of fertilizers, herbicides, 
and pesticides.</p>

<p>Gardeners, organic growers, and large-scale farmers alike are 
finding that spraying compost tea as a foliar spray and as a soil drench 
improves crop yields at the same time it reduces or eliminates fertilizer and 
pesticide use.</p>

<p>A common belief in the twentieth century was that all bugs are 
bad. That's not true. The majority of bacteria and protozoa, fungi, and nematodes 
are beneficial. We want them in our soil. Compost teas are the best way to get 
these microorganisms back into the soil where they can make nitrogen available 
and release other nutrients plants require as they need them.</p>

<p>Compost tea is something you can brew yourself with a minimum of 
effort. We're talking about aerated teas, those that have oxygen actively 
introduced into the brewing solution so that the only microorganisms that 
reproduce are the aerobic ones. This can be done with an aquarium aerator or 
more powerful pump.</p>

<p>You place good compost, that is, compost known to have millions 
of bacteria, high biomass of fungi, thousands of protozoa, and a few beneficial 
nematodes into liquid in a container with various food sources to support their 
growth. Worm bins are a good source of these organisms that multiply thousands 
of times in this favorable environment.</p>

<p>After 12–48 hours, depending on the brewer, you strain the 
liquid and spray the tea, coating leaves and soil with these beneficial 
organisms. Biological processes multiply their effects. Protozoa eat bacteria, 
releasing nitrogen that plants can use. Fungal hyphae (strands) grow out and 
bring in nutrients plants need. The beneficial organisms coat leaf surfaces so 
that pathogens can't find a place to land and take hold.</p>

<p>When you use a worm bin to process your own food discards, you 
can generate a diverse and local source of beneficial microorganisms to make a 
superb compost tea to restore and enhance fertility in your soil. What else can 
you ask for?</p>

<p align="left">The <a href="../../SchoolDEEL/DeskRef.htm">School DEEL Desktop 
Reference</a> assists California school districts in researching information 
about waste, water, air, and energy resource conservation. Web links related to 
school facilities, functions, and departments are located in one easy-to-find 
page. You’ll find useful information, including school survey data, model school 
waste reduction programs, and school district policies to implement and sustain 
your school district’s resource conservation program. By achieving your 
district’s overall environmental objectives, your district will have efficient 
facilities for teachers and staff while realizing cost savings. Check it out!</p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="CHPS">Collaborative</a> for High Performance Schools (CHPS) 
Professional Design Trainings</h2>
<p align="left">The FREE all-day
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.chps.net/events/workshops.htm">Collaborative for High 
Performance Schools (CHPS) Professional Design Trainings</a> are tailored for 
project managers, architects, engineers and the general public. The goal of this 
training is to educate all attendees about the benefits of high performance 
school construction as defined by CHPS.</p>
<p align="left">The training will give those involved in school construction the 
tools and resources to design and build educational facilities that are safe, 
healthy, efficient, and provide the amenities for a quality education. The 
training will begin with a general overview that identifies a CHPS classroom and 
the benefits of utilizing the design guidelines and provides case study examples.</p>
<p align="left">This will be followed by a panel of experts who will present a 
breakdown of design strategies that are defined in Volume II of the CHPS Best 
Practices Manual. Case study examples will be provided and time will be allotted 
so that attendees may ask questions. Each attendee will also receive a free set 
of the CHPS Best Practices Manual. Six hours of Continuing Education AIA Credits 
will be provided.</p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="Truckee">Truckee</a> School Features Sustainable 
Design</h2>
<p align="left">Truckee Middle School is expected to be 25 percent more energy-efficient than California standards and yield approximately $17,000 in savings 
annually. It is one of many Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS)
<a href="/Publications/default.asp?pubid=1030">demonstration school projects</a> 
in the state. With an estimated completion date of August 2004, the 87,000 sq. 
ft. project has a total budget of $24 million ($275 per sq. ft.) and is designed 
to serve 1,000 students in the sixth- through eighth-grade levels. The new 
middle school will be an energy-efficient building with a ground-source heat 
pump for heating and cooling, feature recycled-content and low-emitting 
materials, and recycle at least 50 percent of the construction waste generated.</p>
