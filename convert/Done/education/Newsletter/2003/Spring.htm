<h2 align="left"><a name="SEE">Energy Funding and Assistance Available to Central Valley School Districts</a></h2>

<p align="left">The State and Consumer Services Agency (SCSA) was recently awarded a $4.5 million grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to develop and implement the School Energy Efficiency (SEE) Program,
a comprehensive energy education and facility improvement project for Central Valley school districts. The SEE Program is comprised of two key components:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Classroom, professional development, and service learning activities designed to educate students, teachers, and school officials about energy
    efficiency.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">School facility improvement efforts designed to provide facility operators and administrators with technical assistance, financing options, demonstration technology, and operation and maintenance training.</li>
</ol>

<p align="left"> The program will deliver these services to 55 school districts in the Central Valley counties of Tulare, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kern, and Kings. Mariposa, Yolo, and El Dorado counties may be included in the program as well, pending approval by the CPUC. The SEE Program activities started in February 2003 and will continue through March 2004.</p>

<p align="left">An important aspect of the SEE Program is the development of
energy-efficient demonstration projects. These projects will serve to expose district operations staff, administrators, and educators to energy-efficient technologies and applications that the district might not otherwise consider. The demonstration projects will also become training tools for the host district and other local districts interested in learning about new energy-efficient technologies and function as educational opportunities for students.</p>

<p align="left">The SCSA recently worked with the Fresno Unified School District to develop a demonstration project at Wawona Middle School. While the rest of Wawona’s campus recently had been modernized, its
multipurpose room still used incandescent lighting with recessed cans to illuminate the room’s 4,083 square-foot space. This room is used by the entire student body and faculty for assemblies, stage productions, recitals, and staff meetings, and is also widely used by the surrounding community for events and meetings. Through this project, the
multipurpose room was outfitted with new high performance electronic fixtures that meet Energy Star
guidelines and a motion control system.</p>

<p align="left">The students at Wawona conducted a before-and-after comparison study on the project that involved collecting data on variables such as temperature and light levels, and conducting surveys on personal comfort and the effectiveness of lighting for various activities. Not only has the lighting quality increased, but the overall aesthetics of the space has dramatically improved as well. Overall, this demonstration project is expected to yield
79 percent energy savings, with an associated cost savings of $3,448 per year. Due to the extensive use of Wawona’s multipurpose room, almost everyone in the school has become aware of the improvements
that an upgraded lighting system can make. Feedback from the district—including the
manager of environmental services, Wawona’s principal, and maintenance and operations staff—has been very positive.  The results of this project analysis work will be entered into the county science fair.</p>

<p align="left">Not only do demonstration projects like this showcase the economic advantages of improving energy efficiency, but they also provide teachers with a more effective learning tool for educating their students about energy efficiency. With the coordination of facilities managers, teachers, and students, demonstration projects like Wawona Middle School will be constructed in several school districts throughout the Central Valley.</p>

Program, please contact:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Peanut">Peanut Hotline</a></h2>

<p align="left">The Plastic Loose Fill Council (PLFC) was founded in 1991 to develop, promote, and implement the original use and subsequent recovery, reuse, and recycling of polystyrene loose fill, commonly known as "packing peanuts."&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The PLFC is committed to helping find environmental solutions through public education and through the development of the Peanut Hotline, the nationwide consumer reuse program for plastic packing peanuts. This 24-hour, toll-free telephone hotline can be called to determine the location of your nearest collection center for packing peanuts. So, pick up the phone and call the hotline at 1-800-828-2214, or search for locations
on-line through the <a href="http://www.loosefillpackaging.com" target="_blank"> PLFC Web site</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">For additional information about polystyrene loose fill and the environment, please contact
<a href="mailto:karen@joffes.com"> Karen Joffe</a>, Executive Director of the PLFC, at (510) 654-0756. The PLFC can also provide educators with a list of classroom discussion topics to encourage student participation and thinking, including the "How You Can Help" idea list.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="CHPS">High Performance Schools Improve Student Performance</a></h2>

<p align="left">Is your classroom stuffy? Is the air conditioner noisy? Does the new carpet smell? These are just a few of the problems that high performance schools help eliminate. A growing number of studies are confirming the direct causal relationship between a school's physical
condition—especially improved lighting and indoor environmental quality—and increased student performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">High performance schools are learning venues that are healthy and comfortable; conserve energy, resources, and water; provide daylighting; protect the environment; and contain the amenities needed for quality education. By incorporating important concepts such as energy, water, and material efficiency into quality design, schools can also become teaching tools to illustrate a broad spectrum of scientific, mathematical, and social issues.</p>

<p align="left">The <a href="http://www.chps.net" target="_blank"> Collaborative for High Performance Schools</a>
(CHPS)
is dedicated to finding solutions to enhance the student learning environment. In
2000 the CHPS released a best practices manual, which has become the standard reference for high performance school design in California. This three-volume manual outlines in detail the advantages, process, and budgeting issues associated with designing high performance schools. Additionally, it provides technical design guidelines and eligibility criteria to assist school districts to create facilities that fit their budget, timeline, and educational goals. A fourth volume currently scheduled for development is an operations and maintenance guide that will also focus on the role of the educator in operating the high performance classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Ultimately, high performance schools significantly stimulate learning, improve student outcomes, and lower operating costs. Doesn't every teacher and student deserve to learn in a high performance school?&nbsp;Learn how your school can be one of the growing number of high performance schools in California.
