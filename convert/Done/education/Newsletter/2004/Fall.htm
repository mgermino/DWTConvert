<h2><a name="SEE">The School Energy Efficiency (SEE) Program</a></h2>
<p>On May 3, 2004, the <a href="../../SEEProgram/">School Energy Efficiency (SEE) Program</a>--a program 
providing energy efficiency education and facility improvement services 
free-of-charge to 55 school districts in the Central Valley--was transferred 
from State and Consumer Services Agency (SCSA) to the CIWMB. </p>
<p class="ListIntro">Funded by California ratepayers under the auspices of the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC), the SEE Program has two main goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Educate 
teachers, students and  the local community about energy 
efficiency through effective, hands-on activities.</li>
  <li>Improve public education facilities and educate facility operators and 
  administrators about the benefits of energy efficient operation practices and 
  retrofits. </li>
</ul>
<p>The overarching philosophy of the SEE Program is to integrate the delivery of 
education and facility improvement services to promote the concept of the school 
site as a teaching tool. </p><p>To achieve these goals, the SEE Program built a broad network of public/private 
partnerships with over a dozen public, private, and nonprofit entities. Through 
these partnerships, the SEE Program implemented many successful projects in 
schools and other underserved communities in the Central Valley.</p><p>Of particular 
importance to the school districts, were the audit services provided through 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.adm-energy.com/">ADM 
&amp; Associates</a>, in concert with other partners. To get an understanding of where 
the school districts were currently operating in terms of energy efficiency, ADM 
&amp; Associates performed free audits for the districts. This information allowed 
the districts to see how they were doing in terms of energy efficiency, areas to 
be improved, and specific steps to take towards better efficiency.</p><p>The SEE Program and its partners will continue to work towards furthering energy 
efficiency education in the Central Valley through December 2004. For more 
information about upcoming events, please contact
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov/StaffDirectory/detail.asp?UID=1348&BDO=3&VW=DET&SL=D">Tiffany Donohue</a>, 
SEE Program Manager.</p>
<h2><a name="Show">6th Annual Environmentally Preferable and Recycled Product 
Trade Show</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cce.csus.edu/cts/tradeshow/"><img alt="6th Annual Trade Show Logo" src="images/Logo250.gif" align="right" border="0" width="250" height="167"></a></h2>
<h3>April 6-7, 2005<br />
Ontario Convention Center<br />
Ontario, California</h3>
<p>The CIWMB's 6th Annual <a href="/BuyRecycled/Events/TradeShow/">Environmentally Preferable and Recycled Product Trade Show</a> is coming to Ontario, 
California! We changed our name to acknowledge the fact that our show attracts 
many products and services beyond strictly recycled-content products. This 
year’s Trade Show is being held in conjunction with the CIWMB’s 6th Annual Waste 
Tire Management Conference--another reason to attend the show!<p>This show has become the premier event to promote the purchasing of 
<a href="/RCP/">recycled-content products</a> (RCP) and <a href="/EPP/">environmentally preferable products</a> (EPP). 
Past trade shows have exceeded 2500 registered attendees and 100 exhibitors.</p><p>
At this show, we will highlight transportation products and services. Exhibitors 
will also promote and demonstrate building and construction, organics, office, 
landscaping, outdoor, and recreational products and services. Admission is free 
and lunch is available with preregistration. You’ll also have numerous 
opportunities to win exceptional door prizes throughout both days. This show is 
informative, fun, entertaining, and rewarding--more reasons for you to attend 
this event!</p>
<p class="ListIntro">
The trade show is designed to increase awareness of RCPs and EPPs. This is your 
opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about the wide variety of high-quality and competitively 
priced RCPs and EPPs.</li>
  <li>Meet with manufacturers on the cutting edge of the industry.</li>
  <li>Conduct business on the Trade Show floor.</li>
  <li>Become better equipped to respond to the RCP and EPP procurement needs of 
  your organization. </li>
</ul>
<p>
With the recent increase in environmentally preferable purchasing policies, we 
will help you meet your organizations’ green purchasing goals. We make your job 
easier by bringing RCP and EPP suppliers to you--all at one time...all in one 
place! For additional information, please contact 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov/StaffDirectory/detail.asp?UID=398&BDO=3&VW=DET&SL=F">

<h2>
<a name="Survey">2003</a> School District Waste Reduction Survey Results Are Available</h2>
<p>
The CIWMB would like to thank all 
the superintendents and district staff that helped make the 2003 School District 
Waste Reduction Survey a success. In addition to helping school districts 
minimize the expenditure of education dollars on solid waste collection and 
disposal, school district waste reduction programs can assist jurisdictions in 
meeting the solid waste diversion requirements of the Integrated Waste 
Management Act. As a result, the CIWMB is making the survey data available 
online to facilitate networking among school districts, jurisdictions and 
haulers/service providers to share successful program information and to expand 
such successes statewide.</p><p class="ListIntro">
Some survey results you may find interesting:</p>
<ul>
	<li>92 percent of reporting districts appear to have some level of recycling programs.</li>
	<li>62 percent of reporting districts indicated that they purchase some type of 
recycled-content products.</li>
	<li>58 percent plan new building construction or renovation projects to begin within the 
next two years.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ListIntro">
<a href="../../WasteReduce/Survey/">A complete summary and analysis of the survey data</a> 
is now available in a final 
report on the CIWMB’s School Waste Management Education and Assistance website. Additionally, new data 
reports based on the 2003 survey results enable users to search for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Responding school districts.</li>
	<li>Survey data by selected diversion program categories and county(s).</li>
	<li>School district contact information.</li>
	<li>Previous school district survey data.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ListIntro">
The survey data and related resources are powerful tools for school district 
diversion program planning and networking purposes. School districts can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View 
completed survey forms from their own school district, neighboring districts, and 
districts statewide to research different waste reduction programs being 
implemented.</li>
  <li>Use their survey data as a baseline regarding 
existing waste reduction program implementation and as a tool to identify 
potential program improvements and/or expansions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once a district has an idea of 
additional programs it might like to implement, improve, or expand, district 
representatives can query the survey data for specific waste reduction 
activities to see which school districts have implemented those programs. 
Contact information is then available and can be used to connect with these 
districts about specific program logistics and resources. Additionally, by 
contacting the school district’s <a href="/OLA/Contacts.asp">jurisdiction (city or county) representative</a> 
for recycling, a school district can 
access additional  support and resources in an effort to establish 
successful districtwide waste reduction programs.</p><p>
CIWMB staff uses the survey data collected to customize its 
<a href="../../WasteReduce/">school-related waste 
reduction resources</a> and to help 
coordinate the efforts of jurisdictions and school districts to reduce solid 
waste generation at schools. By understanding which programs school districts 
are already implementing and identifying areas of need, CIWMB staff can continue 
to assist jurisdictions and school districts through the continued development 
and improvement of its technical assistance tools and resources.</p><p>
CIWMB staff  collects information on successful school district 
waste reduction programs and partnerships to <a href="../../WasteReduce/Models/">share as models</a> on 
our school waste 
management education and assistance website. If your district and/or school has an 
effective diversion program that you think can serve as a model for others, please contact
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.calepa.ca.gov/StaffDirectory/detail.asp?UID=420&BDO=3&VW=DET&SL=K">Chris Kinsella</a>. Additionally, CIWMB staff would like to hear about 
successes or specific challenges to implementing school district waste reduction 
programs, so please take the time to share any such experiences.</p>
