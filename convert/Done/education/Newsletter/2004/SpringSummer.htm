<img border="1" src="images/LibraryDeskSm.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/LibraryDesk.jpg" alt="Front desk at new library" align="right" width="150" height="112"></a><a name="Library">A Sequel Unlike Any Other</a></h2>
<p>In this era when public school budgets are limited and 
educational needs continue to rise, a little creativity and a lot of dedication 
goes a long way.</p>
<p>Parents and volunteers saw the fruits of their four-year 
endeavor as Kenter Canyon Charter School’s new library was dedicated on May 17, 
2004. About 150 people turned out for the dedication. As impressive as the 
dedication of the parents and volunteers is, it is the fairy-tale story of the 
movie-set house that became a library that is so captivating.</p>
<p>Kenter Canyon, a public elementary school in Los Angeles, was 
built in 1955 and its original library served a student body much smaller than 
today's 420 students.</p>
<p>When the financially strapped Los Angeles Unified School 
District (LAUSD) discontinued funding libraries in the district several years 
ago, Kenter Canyon’s library was among those closed. The Kenter Canyon Parent 
Support Group (KCPSG) rallied  to reopen the library in 1993 on a 
part-time basis by raising enough funds to support a part-time librarian and a 
small stipend for books and other needed supplies.</p>
<p>In 2001, a Kenter Canyon parent learned that a fully engineered 
and architecturally distinctive house, built of Douglas fir for the film "Life as 
a House", was scheduled to be demolished at the end of filming. When fellow 
parent and architect Scott MacGillivray saw the house the day before it was 
slated to be destroyed, he was amazed at the value of the building and conceived 
the idea of reusing it as a Kenter Canyon's new library. Once the donation was 
legally completed, a team of 20 professional carpenters spent four days taking 
the building apart, numbering all the pieces, and putting them in storage. Two 
years later, the house was rebuilt on the school’s property where it now serves 
as the new library.</p>
<p><a href="images/LibOld.jpg">
<img border="1" src="images/LibOldSm.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/LibOld.jpg" alt="Old library interior" align="left" width="150" height="112"></a>The original library had become so cramped it was unable 
to accommodate even one entire classroom at a time. Now, several classrooms can 
enjoy the library simultaneously.
A $50,000 Reuse Assistance Grant from the California Integrated Waste Management 
Board (<a href="/Reuse/Grants/LGAssist/3rdCycle/LAArticle.htm">see CIWMB article</a>) 
was among the hundreds of thousands of dollars donated by parents, neighbors, 
nonprofits, and businesses to complete the project. Kenter Canyon worked in 
collaboration with the City of Los Angeles to complete the Reuse Assistance 
Grant. The new library is named in honor of Adda and Paul Safran, parents of the 
principal benefactor, Thomas Safran.</p>
<p>The core of the New Library Committee consisted of five Kenter Canyon parents, 
who carried on past the time that their children would be able to utilize the 
new library. Out of their 10 children, only one will be at Kenter Canyon next 
year to enjoy the library.</p>
<p>Reusing the house enabled the school to save 50 percent of the 
natural resources and energy it would have taken to add onto and remodel the 
existing library. The shelving was removed from the original library and is 
utilized in the new library; the original library now serves as Kenter Canyon’s 
art gallery.</p>
<p>While the new library is the largest reuse effort ever conducted 
at Kenter Canyon, the administration and the parent committee have consistently 
exercised this type of creative thinking about reuse. When the school rebuilt 
its playground several years ago, LAUSD saved the replaced equipment and 
installed it at another school in the district. Parent volunteers also built a 
reading garden at the school using bricks salvaged from a construction site.</p>
<p>This library project is a creative and productive way to promote 
reuse of construction materials that would have otherwise ended up in a 
landfill. This creative thinking will hopefully provide other schools with ideas 
to create their own reuse success story.</p>

<h2><a name="RISE">Recycling Is Simply Elementary</a> (RISE)</h2>
<p>Five local groups have joined forces to create the Davis Joint 
Unified School District's (DJUSD) Recycle Program Partnership with a goal to 
reduce the solid waste stream at eight elementary schools by 50 percent. As a 
result, the first day of the 2003/2004 school year began with the theme, 
"Recycling is Simply Elementary (RISE)." </p>
<p class="ListIntro">Each member of the collaboration contributes 
key components to the RISE program's overall success: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Davis Waste Removal supplies the schools with the basic 
  equipment for students and staff to establish a baseline waste reduction 
  program at each school site.</li>
  <li>The City of Davis printed an introductory letter for parents 
  at back-to-school night, explaining the importance of the waste reduction 
  program and encouraging parents to become part of the program solution.</li>
  <li>Davis Educational Foundation works with each school PTA to 
  promote parent participation, prepares informational packets, and assists with 
  program training for the parents.</li>
  <li>The RCC Group, a local consulting firm volunteering to assist, 
  developed a workable model for the sites in order to reach the 50 percent 
  reduction goal.</li>
  <li>The School Recycle Team at DJUSD implements the on-site 
  program and monitors the garbage dumpsters and recycle bins each evening to 
  ensure accurate records.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ListIntro">The main components of the program include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The recycling coordinator works with principal, custodian, and 
  science teachers to organize the program at each school.</li>
  <li>Students recycle their breakfast and lunch waste, with the 
  help of the on-site coordinator, other students, lunch supervisors, or 
  staff--depending on the school's setup.</li>
  <li>Recyclable materials are picked up by Davis Waste Removal.</li>
  <li>Compostable materials (fruits and vegetables) are incorporated 
  into the composting system at each school, as part of the school garden 
  curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.davisrise.org">RISE program web site</a>. 
Additionally, for an example of how the partnership monitors the program for 
effectiveness and opportunities for cost savings,

coordinator</a> (Adobe PDF, 43 KB) on the program’s initial progress and recommendations for reducing 
the pickup frequency of solid waste bins at the school sites.</p>

<h2><a name="RCPShow">6th Annual</a> Environmental &amp; Recycled Product Trade Show (April 
2005)</h2>
<p>The California Integrated Waste Management Board is proud to 
host, for the sixth consecutive year, the
<a href="/BuyRecycled/Events/TradeShow/">Annual Environmental and Recycled 
Product Trade Show</a> on April 6-7, 2005, at the Ontario Convention Center in 
Ontario, California. The show has successfully continued to attract public 
agencies and businesses from California and nationwide.</p>
<p>The purpose of the show is to promote recycling-based businesses 
and the purchasing of recycled-content and environmentally preferable products (RCPs 
and EPPs). The show brings together more than 100 exhibitors and over 2,000 
attendees--buyers, specification writers, project managers, and support 
staff--all the people that make procurement decisions.</p>
<p>Finding procurement contacts within hundreds of State and local 
government entities and private industry can be extremely challenging; 
therefore, we bring them to you--all under one roof. This event provides you 
with an opportunity to gain access to procurement leaders in the largest markets 
in the country, and allows government and industry purchasing officials the 
opportunity to become familiar with the wide array of RCPs and EPPs--transportation 
products, paper products, office supplies, toner cartridges, containers, 
furnishings, flooring/surfacing, insulation, lumber, etc. Attendees can place 
orders and conduct business with suppliers on the trade show floor to help them 
meet their unique RCP and EPP procurement requirements.</p>
<p>Along with a myriad other RCPs and EPPs, this year’s show will 
highlight environmentally preferable transportation products and services. These 
products can save you money--even those that may cost the same or slightly more 
up front will save money in the long run through energy savings and reduced 
maintenance and replacement costs.</p>
<p>Finally, participating in the trade show provides you with an 
opportunity to share information, network, increase awareness of RCPs and EPPs, 
and improve your bottom-line. Don’t miss this opportunity!</p>
