<h2 align="left"><a name="Students">7-12th</a> Grade Students Can Make a Difference!</h2>  
<p align="left">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Solid Waste 
announces the availability of the "Make a Difference" kit, a collection of 
outreach products to encourage students in grades 7–12 to make a difference by 
learning about the environmental impacts of the products they use in their 
everyday lives, initiating school or community reuse and recycling programs, and 
finding and participating in environmental volunteer and service-learning 
programs.</p>  

<p align="left">Visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/education/mad.htm">
educational resources page</a> to order a kit and to see other environmental educational materials. </p>  

<h2 align="left"><a name="RCP">5th Annual</a> Recycled Product Trade Show</h2>  

<p align="left"><strong>March 10-11, 2004<br />
Sacramento Convention Center</strong></p>  

<p align="left">For the past four years, the  Board has hosted the
<a href="/BuyRecycled/Events/TradeShow/">Recycled Product 
Trade Show</a>, in partnership with other public agencies and the private 
sector. The trade show, now in its fifth year, has become a high-profile 
priority to the Board and the premiere West Coast event. The purpose of the show 
is to promote recycling-based businesses and the purchasing of <a href="/RCP/">recycled-content 
products</a> 
(RCP) and <a href="/EPP/">environmentally preferable products</a> (EPP). The show brings together 
more than 100 exhibitors and over 2000 attendees--buyers, specification writers, 
project managers, and support staff--all the people that make procurement 
decisions.</p>  

<p align="left">The Recycled Product Trade Show provides an opportunity for RCP 
and EPP suppliers to gain access to procurement leaders in the largest markets 
in the country, and allows government, industry, and school purchasing officials 
the opportunity to become familiar with the wide array of RCPs and EPPs. 
Attendees can place orders and conduct business with suppliers on the trade show 
floor to help them meet their unique RCP and EPP procurement requirements.</p>  

<p align="left">Buying RCPs and EPPs is not only good for the environment, but 
good for business as well. Recycling-based businesses support markets by 
creating jobs and producing value-added goods from materials diverted from local 
waste streams, while supplying products to meet the growing environment-friendly 
purchasing needs of government agencies, schools, and businesses.</p>  

<p align="left">Along with myriad of other RCPs and EPPs, <strong>this year’s show 
will highlight sustainable building products and services</strong>–-products with low 
embodied energy, long life spans, no or low volatile organic compounds. These 
products can save you money--even those that may cost the same or slightly more 
up front will save money in the long run through reduced maintenance and 
replacement costs.</p>  

<p align="left"><strong>Why Attend…?</strong><br />
As an attendee, you will have the opportunity to <strong>learn about new products</strong> 
and emerging marketing trends; talk directly to over 100 product suppliers and 
have them respond instantly to your questions and needs; explore a wide variety 
of high-quality products--paper products, office supplies, toner cartridges, 
building products, containers, furnishings, flooring/surfacing, insulations, 
lumber, etc.--and see how far RCP and EPP manufacturers have come with price, 
quality, and availability.</p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Survey">2003</a> Waste Reduction Survey</h2>

<p align="left">Has your school district completed its 
2003 waste reduction survey? Does your district have waste reduction programs in place such 
as making double-sided copies, leaving grass clippings on the lawn, or using 
washable plastic lunch trays? Let us know! In early December, a letter was sent 
to every California superintendent regarding the new
<a href="/ReduceWaste/Schools/survey/2003/">online school 
waste reduction survey</a>. This letter included a user name and password to 
ensure the correct information would be captured for each district. </p>

<p align="left">This survey is important to collect information about what is 
going on in schools, provide outreach and assistance, and develop peer-matching 
opportunities. We are encouraging all superintendents to fill this out or to 
have the person at your district with recycling and waste reduction program 
knowledge to complete it as soon as possible. </p>

<p align="left">The <a href="/ReduceWaste/Schools/survey/">results of this survey</a> will be placed on our 
Web site along with prior survey 
information. </p>

<p align="left">We look forward to receiving your 2003 information. If you have 
misplaced your letter with your user name and password, please give us a call at 
(916) 341- 6199.</p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="UES">School</a> DEEL Unified Education Strategy Grant 
Program</h2>

<p align="left"><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The <a href="../../SB373/Updates.htm#UES">Unified 
Education Strategy (UES) Grant Program</a> is a component of the School 
Diversion and Environmental Education Law ("School DEEL") Program, formerly 
referred to as SB 373.</p>

<p align="left">The purpose of the <a href="../../SB373">School DEEL </a>Program 
is to focus on building and bridging school district waste diversion and 
resource conservation programs with standards-based instructional strategies.</p>

<p align="left" class="ListIntro">The principle goals of the UES, as described in the legislation, 
are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
Coordinate instructional strategies for providing active pupil 
participation with on-site conservation efforts.

  </li>
  <li>
Promote service-learning opportunities between schools and local 
communities.

  </li>
  <li>
Assess the impact of the UES on student achievement and resource 
conservation.

  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><strong>Grants Awarded</strong><br />
The UES Grant Program was designed as a two-phase process, with each phase 
running approximately one year (2003/04 and 2004/05). Funding is also provided 
in two phases. Phase One is the planning phase, with grant awards set at $27,000 
per grantee. Phase Two is the implementation phase, with grant awards in amounts 
up to $38,000 per grantee. </p>

<p align="left" class="ListIntro">The competitive grant process for UES grant awards took place 
from January through March 2003. Fourteen grant proposals were recommended for 
funding. There are currently 13 grantees participating in the program. 
They are: </p>

  </li>
  <li>
<p align="left">San Carlos SD (San Mateo County)</p>

  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">During the last several months, grantees have attended a two-day 
training workshop which focused on developing a campus needs assessment (CNA); 
begun working in teams at their specific sites to further develop their CNAs; 
and some grantees have field-tested their CNAs.</p>

<p align="left">In January and February 2004, they will continue field-testing 
and revising their CNAs and create their implementation plans for 
Phase Two funding consideration by the Board. </p>

<p align="left">All of the UES grantees have enthusiasm and great dedication to 
the projects and programs they are developing. In summer 2004 the grantees’ 
teams will attend a four-day training institute on the EIC Model<sup>TM</sup>. 
They will continue to receive technical assistance from the Board and its 
consultant, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seer.org">State Education and 
Environment Roundtable</a>, creators of the EIC Model<sup>TM</sup>. </p>

<p align="left">The Board looks forward to developing web pages to spotlight the 
progress and products that the UES grantees will produce during 2004. Check our 
web site frequently <a href="../../SB373/Updates.htm">for more information</a> about this exciting program.</p>
