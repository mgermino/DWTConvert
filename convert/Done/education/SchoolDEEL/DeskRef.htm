        <h2>Background</h2>        

        <p>This reference was created 
        to assist California school districts in a number of ways. Most 
        importantly, it pulls together waste, water, air, and energy resource 
        conservation information and Web links  all related to 
        school facilities, functions, and departments. If you’ve ever had a 
        question about how to start a school district composting program, where 
        to purchase recycled content paper, or how to build a better school 
        campus while conserving air, energy and water resources, this reference was 
        created with you in mind. </p>        

        <p>You’ll find useful information, including school survey data, model 
        school waste reduction programs and much more, to help start and fully 
        implement your school district’s waste reduction and resource 
        conservation program. Your school district will benefit as you integrate 
        your resource conservation efforts with your environmental curriculum. By 
        doing so, your school district will realize cost savings, and more 
        efficient facilities for students, teachers, staff and the community as 
        well as helping achieve your district’s overall environmental objectives.</p>        

        <h2><a name="WasteManagement">Waste Management</a></h2>        

        <p>Whether you are a school district administrator concerned about 
        increases in solid waste disposal costs, or a city/county recycling 
        coordinator working with a local school district, setting up or 
        improving an existing <a href="../WasteReduce">school waste reduction</a> 
        program can benefit everyone involved. If you are looking for a specific section read further to 
        find a description for some of the sections provided.</p>        

        <p><strong>California Waste Stream Profiles: Public School Districts</strong></p>        

        <p>This easy to use <a href="/Profiles/Schools/">database</a> provides 
        school district summary data for waste composition, diversion programs, 
        and education curriculum, along with general statistics about each 
        district. The Profiles database provides summary information on grants, 
        awards, and other assistance provided by the CIWMB, contacts for more 
        information, and links to school-related sites inside and outside the 
        CIWMB. Use this resource to gain an initial overview of your district in 
        terms of waste types and diversion programs and to obtain contact 
        information. Find out what your school district is doing in regards to 
        waste management efforts, and check out other school districts.</p>        

        <p><strong>Waste Reduction Survey </strong></p>
		<p>School Districts can view completed survey forms from their own 
		school district, neighboring districts and districts statewide to find 
		out which waste reduction programs are being implemented by using the 
		School District Waste Reduction Survey website
		<a href="/ReduceWaste/Schools/Survey/">
		http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/ReduceWaste/Schools/Survey/</a>. Using survey 
		data from your school district is a great way to establish a baseline 
		regarding existing waste reduction program implementation and to use as 
		a tool to identify potential program improvements and/or expansions. 
		Once you have an idea of additional programs you might like to 
		implement, improve or expand, you can query the survey data for specific 
		waste reduction activities to see which school districts have 
		implemented those programs. Contact information is then available and 
		can be used to connect with these districts about specific program 
		logistics and resources. School District Diversion Report</p>        

        <p>The School District Diversion Project was initiated in response to 
        Public Resources Code section 42620–42622 which requires the CIWMB to 
        implement a waste reduction program for school districts. This includes the 
        development of a model waste reduction program, training, and ongoing 
        assistance, and information on programs for other states and 
        institutions. The School District Diversion Project provides 
        <a href="../WasteReduce/Report2000/">initial key 
        findings</a> which spotlight strategies and barriers in six pilot model 
        school waste reduction programs. Learn how these findings can benefit 
        you in developing your school districts waste reduction plan.</p>        

        <p><strong>Solid Waste Characterization</strong></p>        

        <p>Have you ever wanted to know how much paper, glass, food, and other wastes 
        are discarded in your city, county, or by a specific generator (i.e., 
        business type)? By using 
        the waste characterization information for solid waste planning, local 
        government planners, haulers, recyclers, and businesses can estimate the amount of 
        specific materials in their waste stream through this 
        <a href="/WasteChar/JurisSel.asp">database</a>.</p>        

        <p>The CIWMB’s <a href="/WasteChar/">waste characterization information</a> helps businesses and 
        school districts understand what is in their waste streams—a first step 
        in developing strategies to reduce waste and cut disposal costs.</p>        

        <p><strong>Waste Reduction Strategies for Each Department Within a School 
        District</strong></p>        

        <p>Reduce-Reuse-Recycle is a resource conservation philosophy promoting 
        reduction in solid waste generation through changes in the manner in 
        which materials are purchased, used, and discarded. This approach can 
        easily be integrated into a school district’s business and educational 
        culture to conserve resources, reduce waste, and save money. 
        <a href="../WasteReduce/Strategies.htm">Strategies</a> to 
        facilitate district administration policy and procedures, successful 
        contracting for waste management services, buying recycled-content 
        products, and resources for greening school districts building projects 
        are just a few strategies 
        highlighted.</p>        

        <p><strong>Model School Waste Reduction Programs</strong></p>        

        <p>Many school districts have already been successful in improving their 
        economic and environmental performance through the implementation of 
        waste reduction initiatives. Using the link below, you will learn about 
        successful waste prevention, composting, and recycling programs in 
        school districts throughout the State. From rural programs that collect 
        cafeteria waste for vermicomposting to urban districts that take 
        advantage of cooperative recycled-product purchasing opportunities, this 
        resource contains information shared from various districts that have 
        developed active, successful programs to reduce waste and save money!</p>        

        <p>CIWMB selected a variety of school districts throughout the state to 
        serve as pilot programs to quantify benefits in terms of reducing waste 
        flows to local landfills and saving schools money. To give you an idea 
        of the waste prevention techniques schools are implementing, here are a 
        few <a href="../WasteReduce/Models/">success stories</a>.</p>        

        <p><strong>Waste Reduction Strategies at Large Venues and Events </strong> </p>        

        <p>Looking for information about reducing waste disposal fees and 
        increasing recycling when you host a large special event in your school 
        district, such as a 
        football game or concert? <a href="/Venues/">This website</a> 
        provides advice on developing a special event waste reduction program 
        including: getting management support,  recycled-content 
        purchasing, program financing and implementation, and getting publicity 
        and community support. You will also find sample waste reduction 
        facility polices and use permit language.</p>        

        <p><strong>Household Hazardous Waste and Used Oil Programs</strong></p>        

        <p>Need help with information about what to do with <a href="/HHW/">household hazardous 
        waste and used oil</a>. This web page provides you with program information 
        on collection centers, grants, and alternatives to the illegal disposal 
        of household hazardous waste and used oil to protect 
        California's environment.</p>        

        <p><strong>Green Building Design and Construction</strong></p>        

        <p>Sustainable design or <a href="/GreenBuilding/">building "green"</a> 
        is an opportunity to use our resources efficiently while creating 
        healthier buildings.</p>        

        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chps.net">Collaborative for High Performance Schools</a> (CHPS, often referred to 
        as "chips") seeks to increase the energy efficiency of schools in 
        California by marketing information, services, and incentive programs 
        directly at school districts and designers. The collaborative's goal is to 
        facilitate the design of high performance schools—environments that are 
        not only energy efficient but also healthy, comfortable, well-lit, and 
        contain the amenities needed for a quality education.</p>

        <p><strong>California Air Pollution Control Districts</strong></p>        

        <p>California is divided into 35 air pollution control districts (APCDs) 
        and air quality management districts (AQMDs), which are also called air 
        districts. An air district can cover part of a county, one county, or 
        several counties. These 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/capcoa/roster.htm">agencies</a> are county or regional governing 
        authorities that have primary responsibility for controlling air 
        pollution from stationary sources.</p>        

        <p><strong>Clean Air Toxics Program</strong></p>        

        <p><strong>Regulatory Information for Naturally Occurring Asbestos</strong>. There are two Air Resources Board 
        (ARB) Airborne Toxic Control Measures (ATCMs) for asbestos. 
        The first is the Asbestos ATCM for Surfacing Applications and the second 
        is the Asbestos ATCM for Construction, Grading, Quarrying, and Surface 
        Mining Operations. Also, the  U.S. EPA is responsible for enforcing regulations relating to 
        asbestos renovations and demolitions. However, the U.S. EPA can delegate 
        this authority to state and local agencies. The ARB and local air 
        districts have received
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/toxics/asbestos/reginfo.htm">
        delegated authority</a> to enforce the federal National 
        Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) regulations for 
        asbestos.</p>        

        <p><strong>Airborne Toxic Control Measures for School Bus Idling</strong>. The ARB has approved an ATCM that would 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/toxics/sbidling/sbidling.htm">limit school bus idling</a> and 
        idling at or near schools to only when necessary for safety or 
        operational concerns. The effective date of the ATCM is pending approval 
        by the Office 
        of Administrative Law.</p>

        <p><strong>Indoor Air Quality Report and Possible Mitigation Options for Schools</strong> 
        (AB 1173 Indoor Air Quality Report). The Governor signed Assembly Bill 
        1173 (Keeley) into law in September 2002. This bill requires ARB to compile a comprehensive 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/ab1173/ab1173.htm">report on indoor air 
        pollution</a>, including information on the health effects and sources of
