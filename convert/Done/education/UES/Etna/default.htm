<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p>Located in rural Siskiyou County,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.etnaelementary.k12.ca.us/">Etna Union Elementary School 
District</a> is a tightly knit two-school district that encompasses kindergarten 
through eighth grade. With a population of 800 people, the community of Etna is 
actively involved in school activities and has been supportive of conservation 
and outdoor education programs. In 2003, the community helped to establish a 
two-acre outdoor education center across the street from the school site, where 
students experience gardening activities and riparian restoration work. Prior to 
receiving the UES grant, the district recycled paper, cardboard, and aluminum, 
and had an energy conservation program.</p>
<p>During the first year of the UES grant, Etna Elementary School conducted a 
waste audit that identified the cafeteria as a major source of the school’s 
waste stream. Specifically, the students were disposing of a significant amount 
of the food they were served. Consequently, the school investigated "offer 
versus serve" programs and is now implementing a salad bar program where 
students can make their own choices regarding food and size of servings.</p>
<p class="ListIntro">A team of four teachers created lessons that focus on the 
diversion programs described in the "Diversion Successes" section of this Web 
page. These lessons also served as the context for standards-based learning. 
Because Etna is such a small school, the programs were implemented in all 
grades, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Seventh- and eighth-grade students educated younger students about the 
	results of the waste audit and provided instruction on the classroom 
	recycling program.</li>
	<li>The science lab, which serves all grade levels, used composting and 
	vermicomposting to teach about decomposition and food webs.</li>
	<li>Students learned how compost contributes to sound gardening practices. 
	As part of a service-learning project, students donated fruits and 
	vegetables grown in the outdoor learning center to needy members of the 
	community.</li>
	<li>Students learned how food packaging and their choices in the school 
	cafeteria contribute to the school’s waste stream.</li>
	<li>The sense of community in Etna extends into the school as older students 
	mentor younger schoolmates. Older students at Etna Elementary gained 
	valuable leadership experience by making classroom presentations to younger 
	students. In addition, they collected recyclables weekly from all of the 
	school’s classrooms and delivered them to the nearby drop-off recycling 
	center. Service-learning was a key aspect of the Etna UES grant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ListIntro"><a name="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and Obstacles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The small size of Etna offered opportunities in addition to challenges. 
	Everyplace in Etna is within walking distance of the school. This allowed 
	students to load recyclables on carts and walk a short block to the 
	recycling center across the street from the grocery store. This also made 
	the students’ efforts highly visible in the community.</li>
	<li>Living in a remote community frequently presents problems with markets 
	for recyclables. One of the Etna teachers was able to persuade the driver of 
	the recycling hauler to accept the school’s mixed waste paper, even though 
	the company did not offer this service to the rest of the community.</li>
	<li>In 2002 the district was awarded a multi-million dollar grant to 
	construct an interpretive garden area to serve as an "outdoor classroom" for 
	school use. This UES grant enabled the school to create additional resource 
	conservation and learning opportunities in the outdoor classroom, including 
	a composting area and a greenhouse.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Waste diversion programs established through the grant 
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Establishing an "offer versus serve" program in the cafeteria.</li>
	<li>Developing a vermicomposting area in the science lab.</li>
	<li>Installing aerobic composting bins in the outdoor learning center for 
	campus yard clippings and kitchen scraps.</li>
	<li>Expanding the garden to accommodate aerobic composting.</li>
	<li>Utilizing state of the art child nutrition and school lunch menu 
	planning software by food service staff helping to reduce food waste while 
	at the same time offering a more nutritional lunch program to students.</li>
	<li>Incorporating food harvested from the school garden program into the 
	school lunch program.</li>
	<li>Expanding existing classroom recycling program by adding cardboard 
	collection, and transporting the recyclables to the community collection 
	center.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Lessons">Lessons</a> Created</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Students participated in the following lessons and 
activities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Designed the school’s recycling system and worked in small groups to create 
and deliver presentations to each classroom about how to properly participate in 
the new program.</li>
	<li>Participated in field studies at the Yreka Transfer station to learn about 
waste management processes and policies.</li>
	<li>Investigated and gathered data on various composting methods for the school 
to further divert waste.</li>
	<li>Investigated resources and use of current, local agricultural practices.</li>
	<li>Investigated the elements of proper nutrition to better understand and 
support food service changes in the school cafeteria (leading to the addition of 
a salad bar one day a week).</li>
</ul>
<p>Students used the scientific method to structure and conduct their waste 
investigations; expository writing to describe their findings; and persuasive 
writing to describe the problem and suggest solutions. In addition, students 
compiled, analyzed, and displayed their waste-audit data using appropriate math 
skills.</p>
