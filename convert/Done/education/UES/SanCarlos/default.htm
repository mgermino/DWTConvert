<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://sancarlos.k12.ca.us/">San Carlos School 
District</a> is located midway between San Francisco and San Jose on the San 
Francisco Peninsula. The district consists of four elementary (K�4) schools, two 
middle (grades 5�8) schools, and one K�8 charter school. Enrollment is 
approximately 2,600, with about 360 students in each elementary school, 498 in 
Central Middle School, 485 in Tierra Linda Middle School, and 260 in the San 
Carlos Charter Learning Center.</p>
<p>Although San Carlos School District has taught various resource management 
methods such as source reduction, recycling, and composting, as well as energy 
and water conservation, the lessons were not taught in a unified and consistent 
manner. The district acknowledged the lack of alignment between their 
standards-based instructional programs and materials and the resource 
conservation principles they wanted their students to learn.</p>
<p>San Carlos School District received a UES grant because it expressed an 
interest in implementing waste diversion activities by developing resource 
management audit modules for their sixth-grade classes. These modules were used 
at school sites to provide students with hands-on learning experiences and 
opportunities to develop problem-solving skills.</p>
<h2><a name="Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and Obstacles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This program had six lead teachers and three administrators from three 
	middle schools involved in its implementation. This provided the opportunity 
	to develop a comprehensive unit for all sixth-grade students throughout the 
	district.</li>
	<li>Finding time for curriculum development and implementation was a bit of 
	a challenge due to the various locations of the teachers and administrators.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Developed student-initiated service-learning opportunities to reduce 
	waste (for example, instituting a recycling collection system on campus and 
	educating other students and teachers about waste reduction).</li>
	<li>Developed community-based investigations resulting in identification of 
	community waste diversion and resource conservation needs (for example, 
	encouraging recycling of printer cartridges, storm drain sign painting, 
	creek and park cleanup, clothing and second-hand materials drives, and use 
	of rechargeable batteries).</li>
	<li>Established environmental clubs that work to solve local environmental 
	problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Lessons">Lessons</a> Created</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The San Carlos Charter Learning Center <a href="CampusNeeds.pdf">campus 
	needs assessment</a> (Adobe PDF, 496 KB) contains eight lessons addressing 
	standards in areas such as science, writing, and math.</li>
	<li>Students learned to plan, design, and complete a campus waste audit 
	aligned to California�s academic content standards for mathematics 
	(statistics, data analysis, and probability).</li>
	<li>History-social science classes investigated how waste affects the 
	natural and social systems in their community from a historical/social 
	science perspective.</li>
	<li>English/language art students wrote a short narrative essay from the 
	point of view of a piece of trash thrown into the school�s trash container.</li>
