<h2><a name="Grantee">Grantee</a> Information</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lausd.net">Los Angeles Unified School District�s</a> Office of Environmental Health 
and 
Safety (OEHS) applied for a Unified Education Strategy (UES) grant on behalf of 
the school district. OEHS 
took the lead on this grant because they are responsible for the management of 
waste for the entire district. Additionally, staff at OEHS knew of efforts in 
the schools to combine gardens, composting, and vermicomposting with their 
federally funded nutrition education program. OEHS recognized that many ties to 
curriculum could be made using these existing school gardens.</p>
<p>Los Angeles USD has adopted policies for waste reduction and recycling regarding 
construction and demolition wastes and for the procurement of environmentally 
preferred products. OEHS determined that using the UES grant as a pilot at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openschool.org/">Open Charter School</a> to implement 
standards-based, student-led waste audits and to implement waste reduction and 
diversion programs would be the best way to build a model for other schools in 
the district. </p>
<p class="ListIntro">The teachers at 
Open Charter School used the grant funds to support professional 
development time in order to craft standards-based lessons. These lessons 
provided the necessary groundwork for students to conduct their own waste 
audits. Once the students characterized their school�s waste stream, they were 
able to determine what activities would be most effective in diverting waste at 
their school. School lunch waste became their focus, with a plan to have students 
separate their waste into three categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organic waste (non-meat) to make compost in the school garden.</li>
	<li>Beverage containers.</li>
	<li>Unsoiled cardboard food trays.</li>
</ul>
<p>The students also conducted a trial food waste diversion strategy that did 
not require the separation of food wastes. This anaerobic, containerized method 
was based on a fermentation process called Bokashi. It is hoped that this method 
would streamline the lunchtime waste diversion program as well as increase the 
school�s overall diversion rate.</p>
<p>The use of the <a href="CampusNeeds.pdf">campus needs assessment</a> (CNA, 
Adobe PDF, 52 KB), whereby 
students audited the waste stream at their school, ensured the integration of 
standards-based learning with waste diversion practices. The ultimate goals of 
this grant were to implement an ongoing school lunch diversion program, create a 
"waste audit how-to" video, produce and document an environmental play, and 
share lesson plans with other interested schools.</p>

<h2><a name="Diversion">Diversion</a> Successes</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">OEHS has worked closely over the years with CIWMB Office of Local Assistance 
staff and with many Los Angeles USD schools to design and implement waste 
reduction and diversion programs. Ongoing diversion programs include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Paper recycling and toner cartridge recycling at all school sites.</li>
	<li>Beverage container recycling for schools that requested this service.</li>
	<li>Participation (since 2001) in the Collaborative for High Performance Schools, 
which focuses on sustainable building criteria for new and reconstructed school 
sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Lessons">Lessons</a> Created</h2>
<p class="ListIntro">Curriculum goals that were achieved with the 
<a href="CampusNeeds.pdf">campus needs assessment</a> 
(Adobe PDF, 52 KB) 
for grade level 5 
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use of the program as a vehicle to provide real life context and meaning to 
the fifth grade math, language arts, and science standards.</li>
	<li>Promoting student development and use of oral skills, written language skills, 
and math skills including graphing. The CNA provides a strong basis for science 
investigation skills such as problem solving. For example, the students designed 
the waste audit, then afterwards worked together to identify problems and 
solutions to those problems.</li>
	<li>This program provided the opportunity to extend the systems thinking 
	awareness that Open Charter School began in earlier years, enhancing students' critical thinking ability 
	and their understanding that everything is connected to everything else.</li>
	<li>The students' Service Learning project included service to their 
school campus, in addition to possible monitoring of the waste at home, and 
eventual extension into their surrounding community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, the program met the district�s needs to attain 
standards-based education.</p>
