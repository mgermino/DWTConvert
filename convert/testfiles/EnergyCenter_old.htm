	<h2><strong>Sustainable Building Strategies:</strong> &nbsp;</h2>                 

<p> Approximately 80 percent of construction materials, interior                  
furnishings, and displays were recycled or the products of recycled materials or                  
manufacturing processes using renewable resources.�This building exceeds Title 24 energy code by 45 percent. The                   
Energy Resource Center demonstrates modern energy technologies, including HVAC                   
systems, indoor air quality and industrial processes.&nbsp;</p>

	<h2 class="ListIntro"><strong>Examples of Reused Materials</strong></h2> 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ceiling Tiles:</strong> Undamaged ceiling tiles were cleaned and trimmed down to 11x24 
    inches.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ListIntro"><strong>Other Reused Products<br /> 
</strong>The following used materials from the old buildings were either used in construction of  
the ERC, sent to recycling centers, or given to builders who could use them:</p>  

<ul>
  <li>Asphalt</li>
  <li>Metal</li>
  <li>Glass</li>
  <li>Concrete</li>
  <li>Wood</li>
  <li>Porcelain plumbing fixtures</li>
  <li>Debris</li>
  <li>Lamp ballasts</li>
  <li>Paper</li>
</ul>

	<h2 class="ListIntro"><strong>Examples of Recycled-Content Products</strong></h2> 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wood floor: </strong>The entire wood floor in the Energy Resource Center's reception area  
    was milled from Douglas fir beams and posts from the old Banana Republic warehouse in San  
    Francisco. (Oregon Lumber, 800-824-5671.)</li> 
  <li><strong>Carpeting: </strong>Tile carpeting featured at the ERC uses 50 percent recycled material in  
    the face of the carpeting. At the end of the carpet's useful life, the manufacturer will  
    reclaim the product for recycling. The carpet can be recycled because the structured  
    backing allows the carpet face to be separated from it. (Interface Flooring,  
    800-336-0225.)</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement bars: </strong>These are made from unique sources--confiscated weapons and  
    used oil filters. (Tamco, 909-899-0660.)</li> 
  <li><strong>Staircase: </strong>Although modified to meet safety codes, the staircase has already seen  
    a lot of action. It was salvaged from the set of blockbuster movie  
    &quot;Disclosure.&quot; (Warner Brothers.)</li> 
  <li><strong>Accent wall: </strong>The ERC's reception area features an internal wall made from recycled  
    aircraft aluminum and Gridcore made from 100 percent recycled fiber. (Peter Carlson  
    Enterprises, 818-767-0791.)</li> 
  <li><strong>Entry walkway: </strong>Scraps of PVC pipe, used by the gas company to transport natural  
    gas, were added to the concrete mix to add color. </li> 
  <li><strong>Desk countertop: </strong>The decorative countertop of the reception desk is made of 100  
    percent recycled glass. (Glass Tech, 310-202-6002.)</li> 
  <li><strong>Panels for exhibits: </strong>People get their money's worth when they see an exhibit at  
    this facility! The ERC features several displays which are mounted on Gridcore made from  
    federal reserve notes.</li> 
</ul>

	<h2 class="ListIntro"><strong>Examples of Energy-Efficient Measures</strong></h2> 

<ul>
  <li><strong>State-of-the art lighting:</strong> The overhead lighting at the facility will use 1 watt/sq. ft. (compared to 1.5 watts used in most buildings). This upgraded lighting at the 
    facility is projected to save $21,000 to $30,000 annually in electricity.</li>
  <li><strong>Use of old facility:</strong> By using the old facility, the gas company estimates that 
    they saved $3.2 million in land, utility infrastructure, and building material costs. 
    (Design and construction costs totaled $7.9 million.)</li>
</ul>
