<h2><strong>Sustainable Building Strategies</strong></h2>

<p> Heroes Elementary School in Santa Ana, California, will be a  
<a href="http://www.chps.net">Collaborative for High Performance School 
(CHPS)</a> demonstration school sponsored by the 
California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). By sponsoring this 
project, the CIWMB supports the CHPS vision to create a new, improved generation 
of energy-efficient, high performance educational environments. The ultimate 
goal is to create healthy, productive learning environments.</p>

<h3> Use Recycled-Content Products</h3>

<p> <i><strong>Project Goal</strong></i>: 50 percent Recycled Content Rate (Achieve two 
points for Recycled Content in CHPS Criteria).</p>

<p> Part of the funding the CIWMB awarded to the Santa Ana Unified School 
District is allocated for research, specification, and procurement of 
recycled-content products. Setting a goal for a 50 percent recycled-content rate 
means that the project will achieve two points for use of recycled-content 
products in the CHPS Criteria.</p>
<p> Heroes design specifications include several products made from waste tires, 
including tire-derived resilient flooring, playground surfaces, rubberized 
asphalt concrete, and parking stops. Other products include tile made from 
recycled windshield glass, formaldehyde-free acoustical ceiling tiles made from 
newsprint, toilet partitions made from recycled plastic beverage containers, 
thermal insulation made from recycled glass beverage containers, 50 percent 
postconsumer recycled-content paint, cabinetry made from recovered wood, and 
recycled-content carpet with low emissions.</p>
<h3> Divert Construction and Demolition Waste From the Landfill</h3>

<p> <strong><i>Project Goal</i>:</strong> Adopt a 75 percent Waste Diversion Goal (Achieve 
two points for Site Waste Management in CHPS Criteria)</p>

<p> Since 28 percent of the solid waste stream is the reported average for 
construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste in California, this project adopted a 
goal to divert 75 percent of the C&amp;D waste generated. This will allow the 
project to achieve two points for C&amp;D waste management in the CHPS Criteria.</p>
<h3> Encourage Students and Staff to Reduce Waste</h3>
<p> One of the prerequisites of a high-performance school is that it dedicate 
space for the storage and collection of recyclable materials. This project 
allocates recycling containers near waste receptacles through the campus and in 
a centralized collection point to make recycling as convenient as disposal. 
Signage has also been included to prevent contamination.</p>
<h3> Maximize Indoor Environmental Quality</h3>
<p> High-performance schools offer enhanced learning environments for children. 
In fact, they have been shown to increase learning and academic performance, 
which is directly reflected in higher test scores. A study conducted by the 
Heschong Mahone Group (<a href="http://www.h-m-g.com/Daylighting/summaries%20on%20daylighting.htm#Daylighting in Schools � PG&E ">Daylighting 
in Schools</a>) found that students with the most daylighting in their 
classrooms progressed 20 percent faster on math tests and 26 percent faster on 
reading tests in one year, compared to students in classrooms with little or no 
daylight. Proper daylighting design has been incorporated into Heroes Elementary 
School to improve student performance.</p>
<p> Other measures have been taken to improve acoustical performance so that the 
teachers and students at Heroes Elementary School can hear one another easily. 
Temperature and lighting controls have been incorporated into all the classrooms 
to maximize thermal comfort.</p>
<p> One of the most important elements of a high performance school is that it 
be healthy. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air 
can be more polluted than outdoor air, sometimes as much as 100 times more 
polluted. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/targetng.html">
U.S. EPA also states that Americans spend approximately 90 percent of their time 
indoors and that indoor air pollution is one of the top five environmental risks 
to public health</a>. In light of these facts, ensuring that building materials 
contribute to good indoor air quality is important. Heroes Elementary School 
will use building materials with low chemical emissions to help create a healthy 
indoor environment.</p>
<h3> Achieve Superior Energy Performance</h3>
<p> The energy-saving features designed into this school will reduce energy use 
by 20 percent compared to typical schools. Saving 20 percent in energy costs 
annually frees up about $1,000 for each classroom to be spent on teaching 
supplies and education rather than electricity.</p>

<h3>Use the School as a Teaching Tool</h3>
<p>One way the school will be used as a teaching tool is by developing a case 
study that will include information useful not only to design professionals, but 
also to students. For example, since recycled-content materials are a main 
focus, the case study could include information about how many glass bottles 
were diverted from the landfill as a result of recycling them into a product 
used in construction of the building. This type of information is easy for 
children to grasp.</p>
<p>In addition, an end-of-project report will compare sustainable features of 
Heroes Elementary School with a baseline school design. In this �design reuse� 
project, the Heroes building fa�ade and floor plan are the same as in the 
baseline school. However, the report will show how incorporating 
energy-efficient design and using products with recycled content and low 
emissions will enable students to learn about resource conservation.</p>

some light overhead, the school building should regard the children as a garden 
in the sun.</i></p>
