    <strong>
    <h4><a name="75">AB 75 (Strom-Martin) </a><br />
    State Agency Recycling: Waste Diversion: Community Service Districts</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Requires each State agency or large State facility 
    to develop an integrated waste management plan (IWMP) by July 1, 2000, in consultation 
    with the CIWMB, and divert at least 25 percent of its solid waste from landfills 
    by January 1, 2002, and 50 percent by January 1, 2004. Additionally the measure 
    requires each community service district that provides solid waste services 
    to report disposal and diversion information to the city, county, or regional 
    agency where the district operates.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Chaptered by the Secretary of State on October 10, 
    1999; Chapter 764, Statutes of 1999.</p>
    <h4><a name="992">AB 992 (Wayne) <br />
    </a>Solid Waste Disposal Sites: Cleanup</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The measure: (1) limits administrative expenditures 
    for the Solid Waste Disposal and Codisposal Cleanup Program (AB 2136 Program) 
    to not more than 5 percent of the amount annually appropriated in the Budget 
    Act unless the Budget Act specifies a different amount; (2) removes the $5 million 
    annual expenditure cap on the Solid Waste Cleanup Trust Fund; and (3) provides 
    increased AB 2136 Program flexibility, allowing the CIWMB to award matching 
    grants and make loans for the cleanup of eligible sites. With these changes, 
    this measure increases the resources annually available to the AB 2136 Program 
    and enhances the CIWMB&#39;s ability to cleanup high priority and/or more costly 
    sites. This measure was sponsored by the CIWMB.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Chaptered by the Secretary of State on September 
    27, 1999; Chapter 496, Statutes of 1999.</p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#top">
    <img src="../../images/BtnTop.gif" alt="btn_top.gif (984 bytes)" border="0" width="74" height="19"></a></p>
    <h4><a name="998">AB 998 (Wayne) <br />
    </a>Oil: Used Oil Fee: Exemption</h4>
    <p><strong>Description: </strong>Would allow the CIWMB to maintain an exemption 
    from a fee paid to the CIWMB by oil manufacturers producing or transferring 
    fewer than 500 gallons of lubricating oil into the State.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> The status of this legislation can be found through 
    California Legislation Page at www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Statutes/Legislation/StateLeg.htm</p>
    <h4><a name="1055">AB 1055 (Villaraigosa and Keeley) <br />
    </a>Playground Equipment and Facilities</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Enacts the Playground Safety and Recycling 
    Act of 1999. The Act establishes, until July 1, 2003, the playground safety 
    and recycling grant program administered by the CIWMB. The purpose of the Act 
    is to provide grants to local agencies, as specified, for the improvement or 
    replacement of playgrounds. The measure creates the Playground and Recycling 
    Account in the State Treasury for administration of funds and would authorize 
    moneys in the account to be expended, upon appropriation by the Legislature, 
    for the purposes of the program and for the administrative costs incurred by 
    the CIWMB in administering the program. Additionally, the measure provides, 
    as a condition for a local agency to be eligible for grant funds, that funds 
    would be used for the improvement or replacement of playground equipment or 
    facilities through the use of recycled materials. AB 1055 authorizes the CIWMB 
    to adopt emergency regulations to implement the measure. Finally, the measure 
    extends to January 1, 2003, the date before which entities, excluding public 
    agencies, operating playgrounds open to the public are required to upgrade their 
    playgrounds by replacement or improvement to satisfy the Department of Health 
    Services (DHS) regulations (Health and Safety Code Section 115725). However, 
    the measure provides that those playgrounds installed between January 1, 1994 
    and December 31, 1999 shall not be subject to the requirements to upgrade their 
    facilities in compliance with this measure, until 15 years after those playgrounds 
    were installed. Urgency Measure.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Chaptered by the Secretary of State on October 10, 
    1999; Chapter 712, Statutes of 1999.</p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#top">
    <img src="../../images/BtnTop.gif" alt="btn_top.gif (984 bytes)" border="0" width="74" height="19"></a></p>
    <h4><a name="1364">AB 1364 (Migden) <br />
    </a>Recycling Market Development Loan Program</h4>
    <p><strong>Description: </strong>Reorganizes and recasts various provisions 
    related to the CIWMB Recycling Market Development Loan Program (RMDZ). In so 
    doing, AB 1364 reauthorizes provisions that enable a local government to propose 
    recycling market development zones and allows the CIWMB to participate in the 
    California Capital Access Program (CalCAP). Participation in CalCAP, however, 
    would no longer be on a &quot;pilot basis&quot;. Additionally, AB 1364 authorizes the 
    CIWMB to finance up to three-fourths of the cost of each project or not more 
    than $2 million, whichever is less, and extends the term for loans collateralized 
    by real estate from 10 to not more than 15 years. Finally, this measure allows 
    the CIWMB to fund recycling-based businesses within a RMDZ, or in areas outside 
    zones where specific partnerships exist with other public entities.</p>
    <p><strong>Status: </strong>Chaptered by the Secretary of State on September 
    23, 1999; Chapter 467, Statutes of 1999.</p>
    <h4><a name="46">SB 46 (Sher) <br />
    </a>Solid Waste Management</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Would have replaced one gubernatorial &quot;public&quot; 
    appointee with a local government representative appointed by the Governor who 
    has served as an elected member of a city council or a county board of supervisors, 
    or as a city mayor, for at least one term within two years of his or her appointment 
    to a first term on the CIWMB. In addition, this measure would have authorized 
    the CIWMB to conduct a program for recycling used oil filters and appropriates 
    $150,000 annually, for this purpose, from the California Used Oil Recycling 
    Fund in the annual Budget Act to the CIWMB, commencing with Fiscal Year 2000-2001. 
    This measure would have made a number of clarifying and streamlining changes 
    to existing planning and used oil statutes which are intended to assist local 
    jurisdictions, businesses, and the CIWMB in interpreting and implementing the 
    solid waste management planning and used oil programs. One change would have 
    allowed the CIWMB to maintain a higher volume of oil subject to payment, not 
    to exceed 500 gallons, if the CIWMB had determined that it was more cost effective. 
    Finally, SB 46 would have made numerous technical and conforming changes (correct 
    inaccurate references, repeal obsolete code references, update incorrect code 
    cross-references, and move existing statutory code sections) to the Integrated 
    Waste Management Act (IWMA), the Solid Waste Disposal and Co-disposal Cleanup 
    Program, and the California Oil Recycling Enhancement Act (CORE). The amendment 
    to Public Resources Code Section 48650 was sponsored by the CIWMB.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Vetoed by the Governor on October 10, 1999.</p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#top">
    <img src="../../images/BtnTop.gif" alt="btn_top.gif (984 bytes)" border="0" width="74" height="19"></a></p>
    <h4><a name="280">SB 280 (Bowen) <br />
    </a>State Buildings and Publicly Funded Schools: Standards</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Would require all new public buildings and 
    State office buildings to exceed current energy efficiency standards and to 
    be constructed and/or renovated to utilize some form of cost-effective &quot;green&quot; 
    building methods, as specified. Specifically, the bill would: (1) require, until 
    July 1, 2002, all new public buildings, except publicly funded schools, for 
    which design and construction begins after January 1, 2000, to exceed minimum 
    building energy efficiency standards, as specified; (2) effective January 1, 
    2000, establish a three-year phased implementation schedule whereby construction 
    of all new buildings will conform to specified energy efficiency standards; 
    (3) specify what &quot;cost-effective&quot; means for purposes of the bill; (4) require 
    the CIWMB to promulgate regulations, as specified, born on or before October 
    1, 2001; and (5) expand the focus of energy efficiency in public buildings by 
    revising existing legislative findings and intent language. Further, the bill 
    would encourage the Regents of the University of California to comply with its 
    provisions. </p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> The status of this legislation can be found through 
    the Board&#39;s <a href="../StateLeg.htm">California Legislation</a> page.</p>
    <h4><a name="332">SB 332 (Sher) <br />
    </a>Beverage Containers</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Makes numerous revisions to the California 
    Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act. Among other things, the 
    measure expands the definition of &quot;beverage&quot; to include carbonated and noncarbonated 
    water, noncarbonated soft drinks and sport drinks, noncarbonated fruit drinks 
    containing any percentage of fruit juice, coffee and tea drinks, and carbonated 
    fruit drinks if those products are sold in plastic, glass, bi-metal or aluminum 
    containers in liquid, ready-to-drink form and intended for human consumption. 
    SB 332 specifically excludes milk, medical food, infant formula, and 100 percent 
    fruit juice in containers of 46 ounces or more from this definition. Additionally, 
    SB 332 requires the CIWMB, in consultation with the DOC, not later than December 
    1, 2000, to prepare and submit to the Legislature a report identifying any duplication 
    or overlap between the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 and 
    the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act with respect 
    to programs pertaining to public information and education, local government 
    review and assistance, and recycled materials market development.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Chaptered by the Secretary of State on October 10, 
    1999; Chapter 815, Statutes of 1999.</p>
    <p align="right"><a href="#top">
    <img src="../../images/BtnTop.gif" alt="btn_top.gif (984 bytes)" border="0" width="74" height="19"></a></p>
    <h4><a name="827">SB 827 (Sher) <br />
    </a>Recycled Materials</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Requires the use of recycled materials in pavement 
    applications and road construction, &quot;unless the Director of Transportation determines 
    that the use of the materials is not cost effective.&quot; The measure requires the 
    consideration of specific factors in determining cost effectiveness and eliminates 
    initial cost as one of those factors. In addition, SB 827 requires, rather than 
    sets as a goal, that the DGS purchase at least 50 percent of its paper products 
    as recycled paper products and deletes the requirement that other State agencies 
    submit recycled paper product purchasing plans to the DGS. The measure mandates 
    DGS to establish a 50 percent requirement, rather than a goal, for purchase 
    by State agencies of various goods, materials, supplies and products by State 
    agencies. The measure requires, rather than establishes a goal, for the Legislature 
    to purchase at least 50 percent of its paper products as recycled paper products. 
    Finally, SB 827 deletes the January 1, 2001 sunsets on provisions that: (1) 
    mandate State agencies to require materials contractors to certify the minimum 
    percentage of postconsumer and secondary materials in the items they provide; 
    (2) encourage the Legislature to buy recycled products; and (3) require each 
    State agency and the Legislature to buy at least 50 percent of the value of 
    its paper products as recycled paper products.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Chaptered by the Secretary of State on October 10, 
    1999; Chapter 816, Statutes of 1999.</p>
    <h4><a name="1055B">SB 1055 (Bowen) <br />
    </a>Solid Waste: Tires</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Allows the CIWMB to obtain access to a site 
    where tires are unlawfully housed when the situation presents a significant 
    threat to public health or the environment. The measure additionally requires 
    the CIWMB, in conjunction with the annual State budget submitted to the Legislature, 
    to submit to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, 
    a report that describes the expenditures proposed to be made for that fiscal 
    year by the CIWMB for grants, loans, and contracts under the tire recycling 
    program.</p>
    <p><strong>Status: </strong>Chaptered by the Secretary of State on September 
    1, 1999; Chapter 292, Statutes of 1999.</p>
