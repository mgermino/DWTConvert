    garbage disposal districts to the newly created Health and Safety Code. Also restricted
    the grant of a franchise or privilege for the disposal or distribution of garbage, waste,
    offal, and debris to the board of supervisors of a county. Authorized a board of

    city and county, or town by the gases or fumes arising from the fires or ovens of the
    crematory. Provided that every person who burns by fire heat or destroys by cremation any
    garbage, ashes, offal, or other refuse in violation of these provisions is guilty of a
    misdemeanor. Provided that every person who destroys, or who attempts to destroy, the
    carcass of any dead animal, or the offal from any slaughter pen, corral, or butcher shop
    by fire within 1/4 mile of any city, town, or village, except in a crematory, the
    construction and operation of which is satisfactory to the Board of Health of a city or a
    health officer of a town, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the
    county jail not exceeding one year, or by fine not exceeding $1000, or both.</p>
    <p>Provided that every person who dumps garbage in or upon the navigable waters of the
    state, or deposits it on a vessel with the intent that it be dumped in navigable waters or
    at any point in the ocean within 20 miles of the coastline of the State, is guilty of a
    misdemeanor. Provided that any person in charge of a vessel who permits such loading is
    guilty of a misdemeanor. Prohibited any vessel loaded with any garbage intended to be
    dumped in navigable waters from leaving any point within the state unless it carries an
    inspector appointed by the State Department of Public Health or by a city to enforce these
    provisions. Provided that any person in charge of a vessel which fails to have an
    inspector on board is guilty of a misdemeanor. <em>(Chapter 60)</em></p>
