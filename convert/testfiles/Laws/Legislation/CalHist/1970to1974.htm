        </a><p align="left"><strong>SB 5</strong> (Nejedly-Z'berg-Dills)--<i>Solid Waste Management
    and Resource Recovery Act of 1972</i>--Made legislative declarations and findings that,
    due to the increasing volume and variety of solid wastes being generated throughout the
    state, and the often inadequate management which may not meet future requirements for
    eliminating environmental pollution and conserving natural resources, it is in the public
    interest to establish a comprehensive state solid waste management and resource recovery
    policy to protect the public health, safety, and well-being, to preserve the environment,
    and to provide for the maximum reutilization and conversion to other uses of the resources
    contained therein. Also stated legislative intent that the primary responsibility for
    adequate solid waste management and planning shall rest with local government, with the
    state bearing primary responsibility for the development and maintenance of the state
    policy for solid waste management and the State Solid Waste Resource Recovery Program.
    Included the following major provisions:<ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>The Solid Waste Management Board</em>--Established the ten-member State Solid Waste
        Management Board, consisting of: one member appointed by the Governor who is a city
        councilman from a city of more than 250,000 people; one member appointed by the Governor
        who is a county supervisor from a county of more than 500,000 people; one representative
        of the public appointed by the Governor with specialized education and experience in
        environmental quality and pollution control; one representative of the public appointed by
        the Speaker of the Assembly with specialized education and experience in natural resources
        conservation and resources recovery; one representative of the public appointed by the
        Senate Rules Committee who is a registered civil engineer; one member appointed by the
        Governor from the private sector of the solid waste management industry from Southern
        California; one member appointed by the Governor from the private sector of the solid
        waste management industry from Northern California; the State Director of Public Health or
        his deputy, as a nonvoting ex officio member; the State Director of Agriculture or his
        deputy, as a nonvoting ex officio member; the Chief of the Division of Mines and Geology
        of the Department of Conservation or his deputy, as a nonvoting ex officio member. (This
        provision was to remain in effect only until the Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
        1970 became operative.) Provided that the terms of the voting members shall be four years,
        commencing on 5/1/73, except that the members first appointed were required to classify
        themselves by lot such that the term of two members expired 5/1/75 and the term of two
        members expired 5/1/76, and the term of three members expired 5/1/77. Required the
        appointments to the Board made by the Governor to be confirmed by the Senate, and provided
        that the refusal or failure of the Senate to confirm an appointment created a vacancy in
        the office to which the appointment was made. Also authorized the Board to appoint a chief
        executive officer to administer the functions of the Board, and other staff. Designated
        the Board as the state solid waste management agency for all purposes stated in the
        Federal Resource Recovery Act of 1970. Appropriated $228,000 from the General Fund to the
        State Solid Waste Management Board for expenditure for the purposes of the Act.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Required the Board to: conduct studies and investigations regarding new or improved
      methods of solid waste handling, disposal or reclamation, and review solid waste
      management plans by other state agencies; prepare and implement a statewide solid waste
      management information storage and retrieval system coordinated with other state
      information systems; implement a public information program for local government, private
      industry, and general maximum environmental protection, and effective reuse of waste
      products; render technical assistance to state and local agencies, local health officers,
      and others in the planning and operation of solid waste programs; study the methods of
      reducing and controlling the litter problem statewide, and report conclusions and
      recommendations, including public education and incentives not to litter, necessary
      legislation, and improved methods of implementing existing laws, to the Governor and
      Legislature by 1/1/75. Also required the Board to study alternative methods of providing
      financial assistance to local agencies for the planning and purchase of solid waste
      disposal facilities on a long-range basis, and report its findings to the Legislature by
      7/1/74. Required the Board to file an annual report with the Legislature stating the
      progress achieved under the programs established by the Act and containing recommended
      additional administrative and legislative actions necessary to implement the policies and
      programs established therein, and required the report submitted in 1974 to include
      information on the financial impact of the State Policy for Solid Waste Management,
      adopted pursuant to the Act.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>State Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery Advisory Council</em>--Created
        the State Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery Advisory Council with the Board,
        consisting of 25 members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate: two
        members of private solid waste handlers; two representatives of public solid waste
        handlers; two representatives of private solid waste disposal facility operators; two
        representatives of public solid waste disposal facility operators; six representatives of
        major private solid waste producing industries, including the glass, can, paper, and
        chemical industries; one local public health officer; three representatives of the
        agriculture and timber industries; two representatives of well-established citizen-action
        solid waste resource recovery programs; one county supervisor; one city councilman; three
        representatives of the public at large, each of who possesses special knowledge or

        resources, or environmental pollution. Also included on the Council the chief executive
        officer of the Board, the State Director of Public Health, the State Director of
        Agriculture, and the Chief of the Division of Mines and Geology of the Department of
        Conservation, as nonvoting ex officio members. (This provisions was to remain in effect
        only until the Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970 became operative.)</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>

      programs; providing advice and assistance to the Board in connection with the study by the
      Board of the nature, extent, and methods of reducing and controlling the litter problem
      statewide. Provided that the Council would be terminated on 7/1/76.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery Policy</em>--Required the Board, not
        later than 1/1/75, to formulate and adopt state policy for solid waste management,
        including minimum standards for solid waste handling and disposal for the protection of
        air, water, and land from pollution. Provided that standards could include the location,
        design, operation, maintenance, and ultimate reuse of solid waste processing or disposal
        facilities, but shall not include aspects of solid waste processing or disposal which are
        solely of local concern and not determined by the Board to be of statewide concern,
        including, but not limited to, frequency of collections, means of collection and
        transportation, level of service, charges and fees, designation of territory served
        through franchises, contracts or governmental employees, and purely aesthetic
        considerations.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>Solid Waste Management Plans</em>--Required each county to prepare a comprehensive,
        coordinated solid waste management plan for all waste disposal within the county and for
        all waste originating therein which is to be disposed of outside the county, and to submit
        it to the Board for approval by 1/1/76. Required the plan to be prepared in cooperation
        with affected local jurisdictions, to be subject to approval by a majority of the cities
        within the county which contain a majority of the population of the incorporated area of
        the county, and to be consistent with state policy and any appropriate regional or
        subregional solid waste management plans. Required each plan to be submitted for review
        and comments to the regional planning agency for the region recognized by the Council on
        Intergovernmental Relations prior to submission to the Board. Authorized any county, with
        the agreement of a majority of the cities within the county which contain a majority of
        the population of the incorporated area of the county, may transfer the responsibility for
        the preparation of the solid waste management plan to the regional planning agency.
        Required each plan to include an analysis of the economic feasibility of the plan.
        Authorized solid waste management plans to include elements, where appropriate, providing
        for subregional solid waste management covering more than one county or parts thereof, and
        provided that such plans shall not supersede plans of any local jurisdiction unless there
        is agreement by all parties concerned.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Required state offices, departments and boards to comply with solid waste management
      plans approved by the state in carrying out activities involving solid waste disposal,
      unless otherwise directed or authorized by statute. Prohibited the Board from approving
      any request for state or federal financial assistance for any solid waste management
      project not in conformance with the plan approved by the Board. Also required the Board to
      prepare guidelines for solid waste management plans and to provide technical assistance in
      the preparation, revision, and implementation of solid waste management plans.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>State Solid Waste Resource Recovery Program</em>--Required the Council to submit to
        the Board by 7/1/74, and the Board to adopt, by 1/1/75, after review, notice, public
        hearings, and modification, the State Solid Waste Resource Recovery Program. Required the
        Program to include, but not be limited to, the following elements: (1) guidelines for a
        major state-directed research and development program to develop technologically and
        economically feasible methods for the collection, reduction, separation, recovery,
        conversion, and recycling of all solid wastes, and the environmentally safe disposal of
        nonissuable residues; (2) special studies and demonstration projects on the recovery of
        useful energy and resources from solid wastes, including, but not limited to, methods of
        recovering resources and energy from solid wastes, recommended uses including
        identification of potential markets for recovered resources, and the impact of the
        distribution of such resources on existing markets; changes in current product
        characteristics, production and packaging characteristics which would reduce the amount of
        solid waste generated at its source; methods of collection, reduction, separation, and
        containerization which will encourage more efficient utilization of facilities, and
        contribute to more effective reuse programs; the use of state procurement to develop
        market demand for recovered resources, with special emphasis on maximum possible state use
        of recycled paper; recommended incentives (grants, loans, etc.) and disincentives to
        public agencies and private organizations and individuals, necessary to accelerate the
        reclamation and recycling of resources from solid wastes; the effects of existing public
        policies, including subsidies and economic incentives and disincentives, tax incentives
        and disincentives, upon the recycling and reuse of solid wastes, and the likely effects of
        the modification or elimination of such incentives and disincentives upon the reuse,
        recycling, and conservation of such resources; the advantages and disadvantages, and
        methods of imposing disposal taxes on packaging, containers, vehicles, and other
        manufactured goods, which would reflect the cost of final disposal, the value of
        recoverable components of the item, and any social costs associated with the nonrecycling
        or uncontrolled disposal of such items; and (3) state pilot resources recovery projects,
        at the state institutions where such projects are deemed most feasible, to provide for the
        maximum possible reuse and recycling of the solid wastes generated by the institution.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>State Department of Public Health</em>--Required the Department to continue to be
        responsible for all aspects of solid waste management and resource recovery as they
        directly affect human health, including, but not limited to, the contamination of air,
        water, and land, propagation of vertebrates and invertebrates which may transmit disease
        to man, handling and disposal of hazardous wastes, and management practices which threaten
        the health of solid waste employees or the general public. Also required the Department
        to: evaluate the characteristics of solid wastes and methods for their handling and
        disposal for health protection; render technical assistance to the Board, local agencies,
        and others in the planning and operation of solid waste management programs and resource
        recovery programs; formulate technical criteria and suggested guidelines for use by state
        and local agencies in developing programs for the local handling of solid waste; and
        stimulate and participate in research and development projects conducted by other public
        or private agencies, especially those intended to reduce, effectively reuse, or
        decontaminate waste products.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Required the Department, not later than 1/1/75, to prepare and submit minimum standards
      for solid waste handling and disposal for the protection of the public health to the Board
      for inclusion in the State Policy for Solid Waste Management, required by the Act, and
      authorized the Department to adopt varying standards depending on population density,
      climate, geology, and other factors relevant to solid waste handling and disposal. <em>(Chapter
      342)</em></p>
