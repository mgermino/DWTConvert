        </a><p align="left"><strong>AB 1938</strong> (Knox)--<i>Solid Waste Enterprises</i>--Defined
    &quot;exclusive waste handling services&quot;, &quot;local agency&quot;, &quot;solid
    waste&quot;, &quot;solid waste enterprise&quot;, and &quot;solid waste handling
    services.&quot; Made legislative declarations that while local agencies are empowered to
    furnish solid waste handling services, many parts of the state are served by private solid
    waste enterprises. Declared it to be in the public interest to foster and encourage solid
    waste enterprises in order that there will continue to be competent enterprises willing
    and financially able to furnish needed solid waste handling services at all times.</p>
    <p align="left">Authorized a solid waste enterprise to continue service up to five years, when a local
    agency has authorized the enterprise to provide solid waste handling, and such services
    have been provided for more than three years; except that if the solid waste enterprise
    has an exclusive franchise or contract, then service may continue until the unexpired term
    of the contract or five years, whichever is less. Provided that a solid waste enterprise
    is subject to these provision only if services of the enterprise are in substantial
    compliance with terms and conditions of the franchise and meet quality or frequency of
    service requirements of the local agency. Authorized a local agency to periodically review
    rates charged by an enterprise and to set the rates. <em>(Chapter 430)</em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>AB 2439</strong> (Z'berg)--<i>Local Enforcement Agencies / Permitting and
    Enforcement</i>--Established a program for the issuance of permits for the operation of a
    solid waste facility. Also specified the environmental purposes to be achieved in the
    issuance and enforcement of such permits, and specified penalties for operating in
    violation of or without a permit. Created provisions for the designation of a local
    enforcement agency (LEA) and authorized an LEA to investigate and inspect the operations
    of solid waste facilities, and to required technical, monitoring or other reports.
    Authorized the Board to adopt and modify standards governing such operations and
    facilities, and to modify the standards, and established a procedure for the State
    Department of Health to object to modification of any standard affecting the public
    health. Established a detailed procedure for enforcement, denial, revocation, or
    suspension of permits, including a detailed hearing and appeal process, specified fines
    for violations, and required any attorney authorized to act on behalf of, or upon the
    request of, an LEA or the AG or the Board, to petition the Superior Court for injunctive
    relief for specified violations. </p>
    <p align="left">Also specified that an EIR is not required for the issuance of a solid waste facility
    permit. Authorized an LEA to issue a cease and desist order for the operation of a solid
    waste facility without or in violation of a permit, and to order cleanup or other remedial
    actions, and to hold the person responsible civilly liable. Provided for penalties for
    violation of a solid waste facility permit or any standard adopted by the Board, and
    directed the disbursement of such penalties -- half to the state and half to local
    agencies. Also enacted technical changes to the Act. <em>(Chapter 1309)</em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>AB 4507</strong> (Egeland)--<i>Siting of Solid Waste Facilities</i>--Prohibited
    the establishment of a solid waste disposal site without a determination by the county

    all state minimum standards for solid waste management, and especially that the distance
    is sufficient to permit adequate controls of noise, odor, and litter nuisances, traffic
    congestion, and vectors. Provided that no appropriation or reimbursement shall be made due
    to duties imposed on local governments, because related costs are incurred as part of
    normal operating procedures. Urgency measure. <em>(Chapter 749)</em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>SB 1395</strong> (Joint Committee on Job Development)--<i>Board Membership /
    Solid Waste Conversion Facilities</i>--Increased board membership by including three

    specialized education and experience. Deleted the requirement that the member appointed by
    the Speaker be a registered civil engineer. Provided for a full-time chairman to be
    designated by the Governor, subject to approval by a majority of the Senate, and to be
    paid a prescribed salary. Deleted the per diem payment for the chairman and ex officio
    members for attending board meetings. Also required the Board to select one or more sites
    for the establishment of a facility for the conversion of solid waste into energy,
    synthetic fuels, or for the recovery of materials, no later than 7/1/77. Required the

    Appropriated $250,000 for the project and required the State Energy Resource Conservation
    and Development Commission to consider an amount not more than $250,000 for the

    recovered material. <em>(Chapter 1246)</em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>SB 1898 </strong>(Presley)--<i>Siting of Solid Waste Facilities</i>--Authorized
    the Board to render technical assistance and make recommendations concerning potential
    waste disposal sites upon request of the board of supervisors of any county. Authorized
    the Board to require any state agency to assist the board in providing services related to
    facility siting, and required the board to reimburse the state for any costs of providing
    the services. Specified that final selection of any site shall remain with the board of
    supervisors. <em>(Chapter 719)</em></p>

    unless specified findings are made by the Board, and exempted a site only if an EIR notice
    of determination is filed. Excluded from the definition of &quot;transfer station&quot;
    any facility, the principal function of which is to receive, store, convert, or otherwise
