    county solid waste planning activities be made by the city which contains a majority of
    the population of the incorporated area of the county. Provided that no reimbursement
    would be made for the mandates imposed by the bill. <em>(Chapter 1165)</em></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>AB 2831</strong> (LaFollette)--<i>Recycling</i>--Required a solid waste
    facility permit for a new landfill to increase the permitted capacity of an existing
    landfill for a new waste-to-energy facility or to increase the capacity of an existing
    waste-to-energy facility to include a permit condition that precludes accepting any solid

    * Provisions of this bill were superseded by AB 939 (Sher) of 1989.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>AB 939</strong> (Sher)--<i>The Integrated Waste Management Act</i>--Established
    the &quot;California Integrated Waste Management Act (IWMA) of 1989.&quot; Repealed the
    majority of Title 7.3 of the Government Code, regulating solid waste management, and
    codified the new Act in the Public Resources Code. Also repealed provisions of the Health
    and Safety Code, related to garbage and refuse disposal, and codified them in the Public
    Resources Code. Established an integrated waste management hierarchy to guide the Board
    and local agencies in implementation, in order of priority: (1) source reduction, (2)
    recycling and composting, and (3) environmentally safe transformation and land disposal.
    Included the following major provisions: <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>California Integrated Waste Management Board</em>--Replaced the part-time Solid
        Waste Management Board with a six-member California Integrated Waste Management Board
        (CIWMB). Required the new Board to include: one member appointed by the Governor with
        private sector experience in the solid waste industry; one member appointed by the
        Governor who has served as an elected or appointed official of a non-profit environmental
        protection organization, whose principle purpose is to promote recycling and the
        protection of air and water quality; two members appointed by the Governor who shall
        represent the public; one member appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules who shall
        represent the public; and one member appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly who shall
        represent the public.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>Integrated Waste Management Planning</em>--Replaced the County Solid Waste
        Management Plan (CoSWMP) with an Integrated Waste Management Plan (IWMP). Required each
        county to establish a task force to coordinate the development of city Source Reduction
        and Recycling Elements (SRREs) and a countywide siting element . Required each city, by
        7/1/91, to prepare, adopt and submit a SRRE to the county which includes the following
        components: waste characterization; source reduction; recycling; composting; solid waste
        facility capacity; education and public information; funding; special waste (asbestos,
        sewage sludge, etc.); and household hazardous waste. Also required each county, by 1/1/91,
        to prepare a SRRE for its unincorporated area, with the same components described above,
        and a countywide siting element, specifying areas for transformation or disposal sites to
        provide capacity for solid waste generated in the jurisdiction which cannot be reduced or
        recycled for a 15 year period. Required each county to prepare, adopt, and submit to the
        Board an Integrated Waste Management Plan (IWMP), which includes all of the elements
        described above, according to the following schedule: by 1/1/92 for counties with less
        than 5 years landfill capacity; by 1/1/93 for counties with 5 to 8 years landfill
        capacity; by 1/1/94 for counties with more than 8 years landfill capacity.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><em>Waste Diversion Mandates</em>--Required each city or county plan to include an
        implementation schedule which shows: diversion of 25 percent of all solid waste from
        landfill or transformation facilities by January 1, 1995 through source reduction,
        recycling, and composting activities; and, diversion of 50 percent of all solid waste by
        January 1, 2000 through source reduction, recycling, and composting activities. Excluded
        agricultural wastes, inert wastes and other wastes not normally disposed of at landfills.
        Authorized any plan submitted after 1/1/95 to include up to 10 percent transformation in
        achieving its 50 percent diversion goal, provided front-end removal of recyclable
        materials and other specified conditions are met. Authorized the Board to exempt a city or
        county from these goals or to reduce the requirements if the city or county demonstrates
        that attainment of the goals is not feasible due to the small geographic size of the
        jurisdiction and the small quantity of waste generated. Authorized the Board to establish
        an alternative goal to the 50 percent requirement, after 1/1/95, if the Board finds that
        the local agency is effectively implementing all source reduction, recycling, and
        composting measures to the maximum extent feasible. Also authorized the Board to reduce
        the goals for any city or county which, prior to 1/1/89, disposed of 75 percent or more of
        its solid waste by transformation, provided that attainment of the 25 percent or 50
        percent waste diversion goals would impair existing contracts, or would interfere with
        repayment of debt incurred to finance a transformation project.</li>

        correct the document and resubmit it to the Board. Required the Board to conduct a public
        hearing on any element or plan which still fails to meet the requirements after the
        revision, and authorized the Board to impose administrative civil penalties of up to
        $10,000 per day for failure to submit an adequate plan. Also required the Board to review
        the implementation of each SRRE at least once every two years. Authorized the Board, if it
        finds, after a public hearing, that the city or county has failed to implement its
        element, to issue an order of compliance with a specific schedule. Also authorized the
        Board to impose administrative civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for continued
        failure to comply. Required each city to review its element and each county its plan at
        least once every five years to correct deficiencies, comply with the waste diversion
        requirements, and revise documents as necessary.</li>
