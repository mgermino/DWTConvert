      different amount and removed the $5 million annual expenditure cap on the
      Solid Waste Cleanup Trust Fund. It also increased AB 2136 Program

      interagency environmental justice strategy that addresses any
      disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects
      of programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and

      disproportionately high and environmental effects of projects. Each State
      agency is required to make the achievement of environmental justice part

      adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies
      and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in

      organization, boundaries, acts, proceedings, and bonds of the State and
      counties, cities, and specified districts, agencies, and entities. Garbage
      and refuse districts and garbage disposal districts are not included under
      this legislation. <i>(Chapter 19)</i></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><strong>SB 332</strong>  (Sher)--<i>Beverage Containers</i>--SB 332 made numerous revisions to the California Beverage Container
      Recycling and Litter Reduction Act. Among other things, the measure
      expanded the definition of �beverage� to include carbonated and
      noncarbonated water, noncarbonated soft drinks and sport drinks,
      noncarbonated fruit drinks containing any percentage of fruit juice,
      coffee and tea drinks, and carbonated fruit drinks if those products are
      sold in plastic, glass, bi-metal, or aluminum containers in liquid,
      ready-to-drink form and intended for human consumption. SB 332
      specifically excluded from this definition milk, medical food, infant
      formula, and 100 percent fruit juice in containers of 46 ounces or more.
      Additionally, SB 332 required the IWMB, in consultation with the DOC, not
      later than December 1, 2000, to prepare and submit to the Legislature a
      report identifying any duplication or overlap between the California
      Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 and the California Beverage

      reclamation sites from the current Integrated Waste Management Fee ($1.34
      per ton). The measure also deleted the requirement that the IWMB adopt
      regulations that define �rural area,� and instead defined �rural
      area� in statute as those cities and counties located in agricultural or
      mountainous areas of the state and located outside the DOF�s Primary
      Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Finally, the measure revised the
      definition of �rural city,� and allowed a regional agency to be
      eligible for a reduction in planning requirements if all member
      jurisdictions are cities located in both a rural area and a rural county,
      and the unincorporated portion of a county. <i>(Chapter
      600)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><strong>SB 827</strong>  (Sher)--<i>Recycled Materials</i>--SB 827 required the use of recycled materials in pavement applications and
      road construction, unless the Director of Transportation determines that
      the use of the materials is not cost effective. The measure required the
      consideration of specific factors in determining cost effectiveness and
      eliminates initial cost as one of those factors. In addition, SB 827
      required that the DGS purchase at least 50 percent of its paper products
      as recycled paper products and deleted the requirement that other State
      agencies submit recycled paper product purchasing plans to the DGS. The
      measure mandated the DGS to establish a 50 percent requirement for
      purchase by State agencies of various goods, materials, supplies, and
      products by State agencies. The measure required the Legislature to
      purchase at least 50 percent of its paper products as recycled paper
      products. <i>(Chapter 816)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><strong>SB 1055</strong>  (Bowen)--<i>Solid Waste: Tires</i>--SB 1055 allowed the IWMB to obtain access to a site where tires are
      unlawfully housed when the situation presents a significant threat to
      public health or the environment. The measure also required the IWMB, in
      conjunction with the annual State budget submitted to the Legislature, to
      submit to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature,
      a report that describes the expenditures proposed to be made for that
      fiscal year by the IWMB for grants, loans, and contracts under the tire
      recycling program. <i>(Chapter 292)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><strong>SB 1186</strong> (Ortiz)--<i>Rice Straw--</i>SB 1186 required the CDFA, in cooperation with the State Energy Resources
      Conservation and Development Commission, the IWMB, and the ARB, to prepare
      and submit to the Legislature, on or before January 1, 2001,
      recommendations for ensuring consistency and predictability in the supply
      of rice straw for cost-effective uses. Additionally, the measure provided
      that funds appropriated pursuant to the Budget Act of 1998 to the ARB for
      purposes of developing rice straw demonstration projects, which were not
      encumbered or otherwise expended during the 1998 Fiscal Year, shall be
      available for encumbrance by the ARB during the 1999-2000 Fiscal Year. <i>(Chapter
      640)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><strong>SB 1210</strong> (Baca)--<i>Sales and Use Taxes: Exemption:
      Returnable and Nonreturnable Containers</i>--SB 1210 added a sales tax exemption for containers when sold or leased to
      persons who place food products for human consumption in the container for
      shipment, provided the food products will be sold, whether in the same
      container or not, and whether the food products are remanufactured or
      repackaged prior to sale. In addition, the Legislative intent for this
      measure stated that food containers be exempted from sales tax and
      encouraged the use of reusable food containers; that the environment is
      benefited through increased use of recyclable food containers thereby
      reducing waste; and that food containers were clearly treated the same as
      food for sales tax purposes. Finally, SB 1210 provided that,
      notwithstanding Revenue and Taxation Code Section 2230, no appropriation
      is made and the State shall not reimburse local agencies for the reduced
      level of sales and use tax revenues which would result from this measure�s
      enactment. <i>(Chapter 758)</i></p>
