      <h2><a name="2000">Statutes of 2000</a></h2>
      
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 1822</strong> (Wayne)--<i>Administrative Procedure Act: Regulation Implementation</i>--AB 1822 made various revisions to the Administrative Procedure Act, which
      generally sets forth the requirements for the adoption, publication,
      review, and implementation of regulations by State agencies. Among other
      things, AB 1822 authorized, and in some cases required, the use of
      electronic communications in the rulemaking process and included minor
      improvements to the rulemaking procedure. It also refined exceptions to
      the rulemaking requirements. <i>(Chapter 1060)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 1936</strong> (Papan)--<i>State Contracts: Claims Against the State</i>--AB 1936 clarified that State
      agencies are required to make a payment within 45 days of a receipt of an
      undisputed invoice. <i>(Chapter 151)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 2244</strong> (Lowenthal)--<i>Regulated Substances: Local Agencies</i>--AB
      2244 allowed cities or counties, required by current law to formally
      notice the public and Cal/EPA when adopting, amending, or repealing an
      ordinance related to the regulation of regulated substances, to also
      submit the full text of the ordinance and a summary of any violations of
      the ordinance to Cal/EPA. <i>(Chapter 294)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 2282</strong> (Davis)--<i>Public Records: Resolution of
      Enforcement Actions</i>--AB
      2282 required all of the boards and departments within Cal/EPA to display
      on their Web sites for not less than one year, every final enforcement
      order issued if the order is a public record that is not exempt from
      disclosure under the California Public Records Act. <i>(Chapter
      783)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 2301</strong> (Lowenthal)--<i>State Agencies: Contracts</i>--AB 2301 authorized each State agency to contract with a joint powers
      authority to perform examinations and related services, as specified,
      subject to the approval of the Director of General Services, or to other
      approval as required by law; and authorized the Cooperative Personnel
      Services Joint Powers Authority (CPSJPA) to administer examinations and
      perform related services for State agencies with respect to the issuance
      of professional and vocational licenses, certifications, commissions,
      permits, or other similar accreditations, subject to the approval of the
      Director of General Services, or to other approval as required by law. <i>(Chapter
      62)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 2799</strong> (Shelley)--<i>Public Records: Disclosure</i>--AB 2799 revised various provisions in the California Public Records Act
      (CPRA)
      in order to make available public records, not otherwise exempt from
      disclosure, in an electronic format, if the information or record is kept
      in electronic format by a public agency. The bill specified costs the
      requester would bear for obtaining copies of records in an electronic
      format; and added to the unusual circumstances that would permit an
      extension of time to respond to a public records request, the need of the
      agency to compile data, write programming language, or construct a
      computer report to extract data. It also required that a response to a
      request for public records that included a denial, in whole or in part, be
      in writing, and provided that the CPRA shall not be construed to permit an
      agency to delay or obstruct either the inspection or copying of public
      records. <i>(Chapter 982)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 2825</strong> (Battin)--<i>Biomass Facilities: Grant
      Program</i>--AB 2825 made
      three �clean-up� changes to the Central Valley Agricultural
      Biomass-to-Energy Incentive Grant Program, enacted by Chapter 144,
      Statutes of 2000 (AB 2872, Shelley). It revised the name of the program by
      dropping the reference to �Central Valley� and the definition of the
      term �facility.� It also revised the definition of the term �qualified
      agricultural biomass.� <i>(Chapter 739)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 2872</strong> (Shelley)--<i>Resources and Environmental
      Protection: Biomass Facility Grant Program</i>--AB 2872 was the omnibus environmental protection trailer bill that
      implemented the policy put forward in the Budget Bill, AB 1740. With
      respect to the IWMB, the bill dealt only with the Central Valley
      Agricultural Biomass-to-Energy Incentive Grant Program. This program
      permits air districts to receive grants, a total of $30 million over three
      years, from the Trade and Commerce Agency to provide incentives to
      facilities that convert qualified agricultural biomass to fuel. The IWMB
      is included as a member of a multi-agency review panel that would review
      all complete and eligible grant applications, as well as report to the
      Legislature on the results and effectiveness of the grant program by
      January 1, 2003. <i>(Chapter 144)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 89 </strong> (Escutia)--<i>Environmental Quality: Minority and Low-Income
      Populations</i>--SB 89 required the Director of the Office of Planning and Research to include in
      the Working Group on Environmental Justice, those entities with whom
      he/she consults on environmental justice issues. It also required the
      Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) to
      convene a Working Group on Environmental Justice and an advisory committee
      to develop and implement an agency-wide environmental justice strategy by
      January 15, 2000. The bill also required a report to the Governor and the
      Legislature on the implementation of this measure no later than January 1,
      2006, and every three years thereafter. Cal/EPA must then post the full
      text and summary of violations or a link to the full text and summary on
      Cal/EPA�s Web site. <i>(Chapter 728)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 761</strong> (Sher)--<i>Environmental Quality</i>--SB 761 required the Office of Planning and Research to establish and
      maintain a central repository for the collection, storage, retrieval, and
      dissemination of specified notices provided to OPR, and to make the
      notices available through the Internet. It also authorized OPR to
      coordinate with another State agency in order for that agency to make the
      notices available through the Internet. <i>(Chapter 716)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 876</strong> (Escutia)--<i>Waste and Used Tires</i>--SB 876 raised and extended the tire fee to provide for an emergency
      reserve fund, tire pile cleanup, a tire hauler manifest system, and
      increased tire disposal enforcement efforts. It changed the amount and
      collection point of the tire fee. The fee increased to $1.00 per tire,
      paid by the retail seller for each new tire purchased from a tire
      wholesaler. Further, SB 876 revised the definitions of �waste tire,�
      �used tire,� �altered waste tire,� �crumb rubber,� �tire
      derived product,� and �scrap tire.� Additionally, the bill made a
      continuous appropriation from the California Tire Recycling Management
      Fund, but limited the purposes for which the money from this fund can be
      expended. <i>(Chapter 838)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 2067</strong> (Bowen)--<i>Records</i>--SB 2067 required the Secretary of State, in consultation with the
      Department of General Services (DGS), to approve and adopt uniform
      statewide standards for the purposes of storing and recording permanent
      and nonpermanent documents in an electronic format. It also requires that,
      until the time that statewide standards are adopted, that microfilming,
      electronic data imaging, and photographic reproduction are done in
      compliance with the minimum standards or guidelines, or both, as
      recommended by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the
      Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM). <i>(Chapter 569)</i></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 2202</strong> (Senate Environmental Quality Committee)--<i>Waste
      Management: Diversion Reports</i>--SB 2202 made a number of changes to the municipal solid waste diversion
      requirements under the Integrated Waste Management Act. These changes
      included revision of the statutory requirement for 50% diversion to state
      that local governments shall divert 50% of all solid waste on and after
      January 1, 2000. It also allowed a local government to include in its
      annual report to the IWMB factors that affect accuracy of the waste
      disposal calculation. The measure also required that the IWMB submit a
      report to the Legislature by January 1, 2002, evaluating the existing
      disposal reporting system. <i>(Chapter 740)</i></p>

      <h2>Statutes of <a name="2001">2001</a></h2>
      
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 173</strong> (Chavez)--<i>Solid Waste: Fees</i>--AB 173 will extend the sunset
date on the provision of law providing that the use, disposal, or placement of
inert waste (rock, concrete, brick, sand, soil, and cured asphalt) for purposes
of surface mining reclamation is not subject to a tipping fee. The sunset date
will be extended from January 1, 2002, until the operative date of CIWMB
regulations. This bill requires that the CIWMB promulgate regulations by
January 1, 2004.� <i>(Chapter 811)</i></p>

	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 192</strong> (Canciamilla)--<i>Public Records: State Bodies: Open Meetings</i>--AB 192 will require
additional public notice under the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and make
various changes relative to meetings of State bodies.� <i>(Chapter 243)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 414</strong> (Dutra)--<i>Hazardous Waste Disposal: Lead: Nickel: Copper</i>--AB
414 will restore the ability of Caltrans and other public transportation
entities to be granted variances by the DTSC to reuse lead-contaminated soils
in highway improvement projects. This bill also extends the sunset date of the
statute specifying that certain wastes must be disposed of at a Class I
hazardous waste facility unless certain exemptions apply. The original sunset
date of July 1, 2003, is now July 1, 2006. This bill was an urgency measure
that took effect on October 14, 2001.  <i>(Chapter 861)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 560</strong> (Jackson)--<i>Oil: Local Used Oil Collection Programs: Stormwater
Runoff Pollution</i>--AB 560 will allow local governments to use the
CIWMB�s Used Oil Block Grant Program to address stormwater runoff pollution
from oil and oil by-products if the local government has already complied with
existing statutory uses of the program. The local government must have also
adopted and be implementing an approved stormwater management program. This is
in keeping with the intent of the California Oil Recycling Act. It also
provides another facet of used oil management for local governments.� <i>(Chapter 500)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 1187</strong> (Simitian)--<i>Solid Waste: Recycling: Tires: Permits: Used Oil</i>--AB
1187 will make technical clarifying changes to sections of the Public Resources
Code. It removes the gallon limit from the Certified Used Oil Collection Center
requirements to encourage more centers to collect oil from small generators. AB
1187 also clarifies that all tire haulers, not just registered haulers, must
comply with the manifest system. It also allows tire haulers to submit their
manifests electronically. AB 1187 also clarifies that the involvement of
district attorneys and county counsels in the tire remediation process�when a
violator fails to respond to a CIWMB cleanup or abatement order�should be permissive.
This would take place only if the Attorney General is unable to file the
petition. Lastly, under current law the CIWMB is permitted to award no more
than $3 million for household hazardous waste grants. AB 1187 increased that
limit to $5 million per year, if sufficient funds are appropriated in the
annual budget from the Integrated Waste Management Account for this purpose.  <i>(Chapter 316)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 1201</strong> (Pavley)--<i>Oil: Stormwater Pollution: Used Oil Recycling Fund</i>--AB 
    1201 will add stormwater pollution mitigation and education projects to the
activities considered as eligible projects for the various competitive grant
programs funded through the California Used Oil Recycling Fund, upon approval
of the CIWMB.� <i>(Chapter 317)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 1553</strong> (Keeley)--<i>Environmental Justice: Guidelines</i>--AB 1553 will require
OPR to adopt guidelines for addressing environmental justice
matters in city and county general plans. This may be beneficial to local
governments that are interested in incorporating environmental justice into
their planning but are unsure of how to do so. This bill does not require any
jurisdiction to adopt the guidelines.� <i>(Chapter 762)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 88</strong> (Costa)--<i>Air Pollution: Odors</i>--SB 88 will extend
the January 1, 2002, sunset date on a provision of law stating that odors
emanating from a composting operation fall within the jurisdiction of a local
enforcement agency and not the local air quality management district. The
sunset will be extended until April 1, 2003, or until the CIWMB adopts
regulations governing the operation of compost facilities.� <i>(Chapter 424)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 373</strong> (Torlakson)--<i>School Districts: Solid Waste Recycling</i>--SB
373 will codify and provide additional direction to existing efforts to ensure
that the children of California learn the valuable lessons of resource
conservation. SB 373 will strengthen the education framework in science by
including environmental concepts. It will also provide for incentives to
schools to assist in the development and implementation of environmental education
programs through a $1.5 million grant program funded through the Integrated
Waste Management Account. SB 373 will codify the existing Office of Integrated
Environmental Education at the CIWMB and requires it to develop and implement a
unified environmental education strategy on the environment for elementary and
secondary schools in the state. SB 373 contains other related provisions.� <i>(Chapter 926)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 470</strong> (Sher)--<i>Hazardous Waste Control</i>--SB 470 will correct a number of 
technical issues in the hazardous waste law overseen by DTSC and exempt an engine oil management technology from 
regulation under the hazardous waste law. It will also raise the limit on the number of gallons of
used oil that may be transported by a person per day from 20 to
50 gallons.  <i>(Chapter 605)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 481</strong> (Speier)--<i>Vehicle: Dealers: Licenses</i>--SB
481 will exclude the cost of the California Tire Fee from the advertised price
of a new car.� <i>(Chapter 441)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 624</strong> (Soto)--<i>Vehicle Cover</i>--SB 624 will clarify that waste
being transported must be covered. The bill adds cardboard to the definition of
waste, pursuant to this provision.� <i>(Chapter 279)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 633</strong> (Sher)--<i>Hazardous and Solid Waste: Mercury</i>--SB
633, the California Mercury Reduction Act of 2001, will set forth provisions to
reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded
fever thermometers, by discarded novelty products, and by school science
materials. It will add penalties for failure to comply with existing law
regarding removal of hazardous materials from appliances, and it will establish
a program to encourage replacement and recycling of mercury-containing motor
vehicle light switches. Finally, it will prohibit the sale in California of
mercury-containing motor vehicle light switches after January 1, 2005.� <i>(Chapter 656)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 828</strong> (Alarcon)--<i>Environmental Justice</i>--SB 828 will create deadlines for the
Work Group on Environmental Justice. The bill requires all boards, departments,
and offices within the Cal/EPA to review their programs, policies, and
activities and identify and address any gaps relating to environmental
justice.� <i>(Chapter 765)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 1127</strong> (Karnette)--<i>Rigid Plastic Packaging</i>--SB
1127 will require the CIWMB to conduct a study regarding the use and disposal
of polystyrene in California. The report will be submitted to the Legislature
and the Governor by January 1, 2003.� <i>(Chapter 406)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SB 1158</strong> (Knight)--<i>Aerosol Can Recycling</i>--SB 1158 will allow on-site
aerosol can hazardous waste treatment to fall under the universal waste rule.
This will allow household hazardous waste collection centers, as well as other
on-site hazardous waste generators, to bypass the certification process and
adopt the inspection requirements that come with the universal waste rule
instead.� <i>(Chapter 450)</i></p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>SBX1 5</strong> (Sher)--<i>State Energy Projects</i>--SBX1 5 will enhance the existing
low-income energy assistance programs, established a variety of energy
efficiency programs, and create a program to increase distributed electric
generation capacity, particularly with respect to State and municipal
buildings.� <i>(Chapter 7)</i></p>

 <p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/BtnTop.gif" alt="Top of page" border="0" width="74" height="19"></a></p><a name="Top of Page">

<h2>Statutes of <a name="2002">2002</a></h2>

	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>AB 467</strong> (Strom-Martin)--<i>Integrated Waste Management: Landfill Closure Loan Program</i>--AB 467 will create the Landfill Closure Loan Program (LCLP), which gives the CIWMB
authority to offer loans to small rural landfill operators and assist them in
closing their facility early to prevent potential threats to the environment.
This program creates a zero-interest loan for operators of older-technology,
unlined landfills. The LCLP is a continuation of the Facility Compliance Loan
Program (FCLP), which uses funds from the Integrated Waste Management Account
